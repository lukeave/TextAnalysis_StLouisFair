the man who knows it ali was trying to conceal the fact that he had walked six blocks to see the circus parade but the wise guy was willing to swear that he had geen bim going anq.had afterward con emplated him in the act of following the ealiope and why not the wise guy wanted te ik cleus parsde than i any e nt us parade any of the parades we will see here durits the worid’s fair a circus parade is natural end unaffected and there is no straining park no flunkyism and no snob such as ore almost inseparable from ether and more pretentious parades if the camels a ahead of the elephants and the elephants ahead of the lions in the order of por the mephacs don’t blow and the ons m’t roar about it that is _some thing which will not be true of the world’s pasneee and functions we are to have ere during ay a a ae ba 8s e judge loo up from the thind chair for the next fi months st louis will be the center for snobs and snobbery of all sorts there will be a strife for place and recognition which will sicken the hearts uf all sensible folk such things seem to be pecpershis from world's fairs igs ey it at chicago and buffalo end they vo had the same thing al though in lesseer gegree at all of the great expositions at paris in europe such points igs been settled for generations by the laws or customs governing hereditary rank and frong which there is no appeal a this country where we havé.no such laws or customs nd where 2 stent many people who do not feel sure of themselves man age to elbow their way to the front in all co displays and dress parades we find most heartrending exhibitions of snob bery in the world there is a strife which beggars all description in its results of heartburnings and bitterness which long ait their occasion during the chicago xposition you remember there was never
a meeting of the board of woman managers without a storm of tears over questions of precedence and yot i imagine the feeling was no more intense among the women than the men aiceaaee the men did mot weep over it in public at least some of them ee have shed a few bitter tears in private but in public they took it out in cussing or kept still about it which was surely the best way these world’s fairs lare great things and no goubt they do a great deal of good but in leaving legacies of envy hate and malice in many hearts they also do’a great deal of harm if pe hon fe stop that irish band from playing wearin of the green said tom my adkins out of a khaki suit in the sec ond there’ll be more trouble than they can take care of for their pavilion isn’t far from ours os eek in by an outlander brought on a chilly silence for a moment nobody wanted to be inhospitable but there was a general as pik a to rally around old ire land the horseman attempted to pour oll on the water but poured it on the fire in stead by saying i got acquainted with the bandmaster and he says it is his intention to dedicate the irish eo by playing the green above the eas instantly the khaki suit in the second was bolt yt gr and tommy growled in a seep bass if they do that we’ll give em go save the king and rule britannia one after the'other and thinking he had dis posed of the matter to the satisfaction of everybody tommy lay down again but vou have no band here said the oe fa geste with an interrogation point in his voice the royal grenadiers band is coming and lord but you ought to hear em play rule britannia growled tommy clos ing his eyes in the double delight of a rem iniscence and a retrospection none of these foreign bands should be allowed in the grounds said the walking delegate home industry and union labor is my motto but if your royal grenadier
band gets in there and goes to playing god save the king it had better look out for snake rang that tune is something he won't listen to without fighting well well said the horseman who saw tommy’s head rising off the cushian again and sought to queil the rising agian t snake has troubles of his own so i imagine he won't try to stop the music but i gn tell you why the irish band was allowed to play in the midway contrary to rules and sepulations it was because they played wearing of the green and every police man around the place is an irishman it was a breach of international cour tesy growled tommy not under the circumstances said the horseman soothingly the audience as ssembled in the midway to meet the party was almost exclusively irish and there are always a great many of that blood in the vicinity of the union station to the imme diate west of which edifice lies st mala chy’s parish containing a great many irish families all of which are now up in army xeainst the invasicn of the scarlet evil l'ho wearing of the green by a real irish band was calculated to increase their en thusiasm but st malachy doesn’t haye to figkt the battle alone this time said the emi nent lawyer in the first as she did two years ago when this same removal of the searlet woman from chestnut and pine and market streets was up and it was known that st malachy’s parish was the place selected for their transplanting at that time the good people of st malachy got little or no sympathy or moral support from neighborhoods not threatened in the same way they were left to sent their own battle alone and they did it effect ually by serving a notice on_the authort ties that if the thing was attempted they would defend their homes by force of arms and they went to arming and drilling for that very purpose but now they have all the help they want even cabanne is stirred up and very much afraid of the invasion i was very much surprised when
i first heard of that and thought it a false alarm owing to the distance of that part of the ote 4 from the center but since i have heard the bas s of their fears i under stand it better they have heard that the scarlet woman is anxious to leave the heart of the city for the bo at and move out as close to the world's fair grounds as sho can get wherefore cabanne takes fright and strikes hands with st malachy par ish in defense of god and home and na tive land it will not be long until iike st malachy they begin ily themselves and drilling to repel the dread assault the star of empire cabanne has seen gress tribulations of late years said the rounder it is now nearly a year since int commenced tear ing up her streets and now those same streets or some of them are in a worse condition than ever before then there has been trouble over the cabanne ciub and the burning question of hard or soft drinks within its precincts then there have been the fiat dwellers against whom the old aristocrats of the quarter have sought to draw a line of exclusion with only partial success the flat dweller is breaking into the sacred precincts df cabanne in spite of em the efforts which have been made to
keep him out a the boardi g house is also ty be inbers out there after the world’s fair the boarding house will be much more in evidence than ever before and so will some other things saloons for instance it all reminds me of a sermon i heard preached a few years ago by a man who knew what he was talking about and wasn’t afraid to tell what he knew he was going after the heads of families who run away from the vice of great city in stead of usin their power as citizens and voters to curb such vices and hold them within bounds you cowards said he whs run away from the enemy of your homes need not think that the enemy will not fol low you he may wait awhile and ovespy the ground from which you have retreated but as soon as he needs it in his business he will march jee the country arde are now ocoupyint and drive you out of it i tell you you will have to move gain and again un til at ae you come to the place where you can go no farther and there you will have etther to surrender or put your back to the wall an oe es i have fhougtt of that on a great ere times within the past rey fe ars when this or hoi part of the west da has been pepoaine for re lief and bape none and this trouble of cabanne brings it up still more freshly to my mind ie tt is the proximity of the world's fair which is changing things in cabanne now said the man who knows it all by bringing things in there for profit which were never there before and which will not linger long after the fair closes its gates i wish i could be sure of it said the sudge i live out there because i am one of the cowards who ran away from vice i have run away twice in the last twenty years but now i am beginning to feel like putting my back to the wall and fighting as that preacher did for i don’t see where 1 could go to now but i wish i could feel sure that the az we dislike so much in cabanne woul move away after the world’s fair but i am afraid some of them will stay one thing you will have more numerous ly and more rmanently said the round er will the boarding house wiis 22 224 zi

louis and they have represented t so tru ly and so ape that we have bred a class of people here who resent any advance in rates at a time of high rents and high prices and great crowds as a personal injury and take occasion to give the city which has teen a generous home to them the hameé of an extortioner abroad i certainly think such people are of little value to any com munity 4 the eminent lawver had worked himself into such a passion that the deep red of his unger showed loud on the top.of his bald head and his barber asked him if he wanted a hair restorative but the em tment ae ag bia s he got out of the chair no i’m waiting to see if dave hill’s bald head can nominate parker the mute for president the convention in this city next july if a bald head can do that i want no hair on mine

views of the world at the world’s fair es es se the press feeders and their view the twentieth century press we celebrate at the world’s fair is one which feeds it self in the course of the year it unrolls automatically enough paper to stretch from the source of the mississippi river to the mouth and cuts it into finished papers each one of which is as hear a universal exposition of the world of a day as ex perienced feeders of the press can make it i have seen the different fee se of feeding this press by telegraph instruments lead pencils and typewriters as it is fed at present and i know a number of those who have fed it for so many years that from being at first elate with the honor the responsibility and the power of the work they have savelapes into the semblance of modest shy so tapoken men with here and there among them as mild a mannered man as ever watched his fellowmen en gaged in cutting throats and scuttling ships that he might be the first to get it on the wires that his press might be the first press of the world to be fed with it through special cablegrams i these modest shy soft spoken men move among the rest of us at_a world’s fair with their capacity for understanding and admiring fully developed admiration is their business and they learn their business only as they learn it at first they reay have agenired themselves as journalists above ail the works of nature and of art and there may be among them here and there those in whom this capacity for ad miration is still self centered so that as they look downward upon all that is best in the world they see ee mistakes which might have been avoided in it had their views of it‘entered fully into it from its be ginnings but these too may so develop tin oo their post graduate course as feed ers of the press that hereafter any one of them may be able’to listen with modest and respectful interest to a_ celebrated prime minister in those countites where celebrated prime isters are educated to make the worse pear the better part as it is fed to the press and when they have listened learned admired and under stood all he has to say of his high states manship they may be able to ask the one modest pet case full of respect or him his high attainments and his exalted place which whether he answers or declines to answer will wrest out the heart of his mystery.that few inconspicuous sentences at the close may give the world the better part along with the worse perhaps cdlleges of journalism in the twentieth centusvy may dévelop higher types among feeders of the press than those whv us the world has impressed itself upon them mre and more in all its various aspects attempt to ontrol it jess and less as they 8e more and more clearly that their a i est duty is to inform it not of what they think it is or ought to be but pr what it really is that at last it may make up its own mind what it ought to think of itself teathers the new century may do this per haps it may do much worse it may be that the world as it is to be can only be revealed te itself by higher types of men than those of the present but when they are summed togéther in their knowledge those who are now in st louis know it as it is in all its continents and in most of its islands it has teen their business to find facts and to state them in ahe time of defoe the first great modern journalist this cast the pillory though it does not usually cost anything of that kind now it still costs so much that the men who feed the press and learn all that must be learned to do the work give as their tuition fee each one the best and cost liest thing he has which is his life as long as it lasts on earth he does not usually become a saint and never in any case a martyr if it can possibly be avoided but when he has made his last statement of facts and his work is over he has left the world with a possibility of less martyrdom for all'the saints it can produce out of its own knowledge of its need for them to the feeder of the press whe comes 1000 or 4000 miles to st louis the world at the world’s fair is more plat et because of all he has seen of the worl elsewhere he may have discovered in the first few years of seeing things that they are very much alike everywhere in their classes but he spends the rest of his life in learning that they are also very differ ent in and out of their classes during the rest of his life he becomes more and more interested in them the man tis has seer most of all there is to see of all any great newspaper tells in the course of a year of what the world means is the man at the world’s fair who is most jinterested in everything it has brought together whether it’s great or small sore omt or inconspicuous he may have wholly lost his gg ange ed for astonishment but in place of it he has developed an increasing fac ulty of interest in and admiration for things that are interesting to si whether they seem admirable to others or not and admirable to him even when others may think nothing admirable unless it is also astonishing among these feeders of the press are those who have entered the senior class in the great university of journalism theirs is a fpticenge of speech art pass here and there on what seems be their owh way but it is the wey thy world is going and what they retain what sticks to them at last without their conscious effort is not merely what the world is saying but what it is actually doing this they will tell it all at any time it is ready and willing to know the rest is for that time part of their reticence it came to them quietly see hold it quietly it is power and if it is the ewer of a great man it is quiet power ow much of such quiet power came to 8t louis with by feedera of the world's press i do not now but i know that it came and that among them guiet and reticent are men as great in all that makes vower to help the world to fuller knowledge of itself as the world has produced it is the highest greatness the greatness which s as itself only in re sults and loses itself in them horace flack

views of the world at the world’s fair 1 x t ae oat seit ree lames xt i the old settlers and their view the old settlers had their day yester day and yésterday was also the day of the talking are light which shows a number of surprising differences from tlhe tallow candle of the old settlers era taking it for granted that the old_ set tler is more than to years old he dates from the era of the tallow candle for it was not until after e865 that the coal oil lamp came into general use betore that time coal oil was sold in bottles asa remedy for rheumatism the era of the tallow candle was followed by that of the spermaceti candle which was not sper maceti at all but a by product of lard such as may still be had at the corner groceries so civilization passed into the era of the coal oii lamp and then inte that of the electric light which on old settlers day at the fair suddenly begins to give concerts or to deliver lectures when the button is pushed to turh on the current for the light __ __ in the view of certain old settld4rs there may be sueh a thing as a eivilization too eomplex for those who ure not prepared for it in the sew of some others there is such a thing as an excess of simplicity this is my own view supported by a dis tinct recollection of a set of molds_for the home manufacture of tallow candles they represented the most advanced thought of their era for they molded haif a dozen candles at a single pouring aft er all the seraps of tallow not available for other purposes had heen saved in some convenient vessel whose odprs were not usually pleasant they were re en forced with cake tallow and after the whole had been heated until it was liquid it was poured through a strainer into the molds where the wicks after.havying been manufactured previously by the old set tler’s wife were stretched on sticks so that they extended through the molds to the bottem which conversely speaking was the top of the candles _as a result of this process such of the candles as did not have air bubbles in them came out ready for use in connec tion with a pair of brass or iron snuffers placed in the bottom of the candlestick for use about once every five wothutes as the wick burned and leaned over so as to geflect the blaze and cause the candle to gurn wholly om one side unless promptly snuffed j here the connectioh between the tallow eandle and the talking are light becomés apparent for when the candle began to sputter us the wick leaned it was under stood to be delivering a message to what ever member of the family the wick pointed at as is set forth with accuracy by the poet who wrote there's a message in the candle and it points direct to me those who infer that my education has extended to actual observation of the manufacture and use of tallow endles will be right as t infer they usually are for though it myself date more especially from the era of the coal oi lamp i have always made ita point from my earl south to cultivate the acquaintance of that conservative element of society which deliberates and consideré before adopting changes proposed in methods hatlowed by time among the donserva tive i found those who gladly promoted my education in those arts which belong t othe most respectable and consistent conservatism so that i have not only ob served the actual manufacture f tallow candies but have actually assisted in it by holding the molds and helping to pro vide the sticks on which to stretch ithe wicks i have also been present and in some sense participating when butternut and other dye stuffs were being prepared for the manufucture of cloth t have never prepared the corn husks or per haps more accurately shucks for the cores of cotton thread’as it is manufac tured on a spinning wheel but am fa miliar by actual observation ith that whole process from carding the batting to working the hand loom aithough i have never actually manufactured soap i have actually poured water into the kve hopper as a_ beginning of the pro céss and i have observed the successive stages of the process so closely that iam eonfident of my present ability ta conduct a:soap factory of the antique spe with aitew suggestions hgts any old settler who hail sufficient jconfidence fh me to permit me to take charge of the work under his supervision a this is not by any means alll 1 know by actu:tl observation and incomplete ex periment cf the liberal and athes arts of the old settlers fdr instance am fa miliar with the process of making both split bottomed and shuck bottomed chairs i could describe with comparative accuracy the various stages of se ture through which a cypress knee zoes before it is.converted into a well bucket and i nave myself manufactured a dip per from a gourd i might go jon men tioning a long list of other things belons ing to the useful or the literal arts of the past of which many in the present know so little that they have not been able to suspect the extent either of my infor mation or their own ignorance when i suggest it here thus ripe beh it is not with a view to bringing myself into greater reputation but rather of suggest ing to many who pride themselves on b ing up to date how great is the extent of their ignorance of the useful and lib eral arts which belong to an era without which they and everything they are proudest of knowing would have been im possiblc i thus an old settlers day at the fair i am able to re enforce them not dnly with moral support but ey with intellectual support made posal le by actual know l edge of the asséentidls of the age of the tallow candle as between the tallow candle and the conversational are mpg hh am not prepared to take the stutid of an extrémist i am satisfied with ve eye less simplicity at present than that of the tallow candle but on the other hand i am not yet preparefl for the time when en pressing the button to turn on the lignt in my bedrcom t will hear a lecture on ethics or a selection from the latest igh there are conditions now imagina ble under whigh the civilization of the electric age might beceme so complex that the only escape from it to a quiet life would tie through cutting the

prefer to start with one of the smaller rooms the one we have selected is number 79 on the ground plan we do this chiefly because it happens to coritain works of a few thor oughly representative painters which are so conspicuously representative of the school as a whole that a point of view ean be obtained from which we can more advantageously judge of the remainder of the collection than if we began with the largest room in the central position on the line on the south wall of room 70 is a large life size portrait of sir david stéwari late provost of the town of afoenngen in seot land by mr william quilier orchardson we have not the slightest hesitation after frequent visits to this superb masterpiece in portraiture in saying that it is the greatest portrait in character color and treatment that in our estimation at least has been produced during the last fifty lyears a similar conviction on the part of those even who have no pretensions to be judges of art can not we think but be also arrived at if they will without prejudice make a conscientious study of this remarkable work the leading characteristic of all mr or chardson's work is the absolute restraint to which throughout his whole career he has subjected himself so that there shall be no undue intrusion of the ability or the acquirements of the artist himself in other words his portraits are s imper sonal as it is possible for a picture to be not only that but he also eliminates from his representations any accentuation of the position in life or the honors which have been conferred upon his subject nor does he care for the exploitation of mere habiliments uniforms insignia of officé or other ephemeral paraphernalia which are so much affected by the majority of portrait painters in the present case the color of the vel vet robe magnificent though iit is is sub ordinated entirely to ihe search for and the representation of the character and endowments physical and mental of his subject the

of the two artists the red stocking the robe purposely ar ecg dp to show it the bright silver shoe buckles the loud cry of the reds and pur ples the silver ink stand and the impor tant looking raw white official papers will be in a position to judge which method is to be preferred the bringing out of the character and using the accessories only as a means of contributing to its decora tive qualities instead of their being forced into prominence in order to help out the ine of its avocations by such extraneous aids 7 the important features of the design before us are the head and the frame of the man himself he is made to wear his honors lightly or at least inconspicuously as possible as if he considered them not at all he magnifies his office and these mere incidental trappings used as they are for their color and artistic eine only are made to appear as being to the wearer the commonest things to sense so subtly and so tastefully subordinated are they to the personality how

an expert’s notes on world’s fair pictures holland room 34 no 1 1 summer morning by willem hendrik mesdag the hague the painter of this beautiful picture is a man of inde pendent means a great collector of art objects and practically the doyen of the artists of his native country this picture must either stand or fall by the manner in which the sun is introduced and its in fluence on the landscape it has however as we see been very subtly piaced it is a ges 4 toward the right of the center anc at such a height as to suggest an overhead sky and at the same time by its elevation above the tallest masts in the foresea it is made to suggest illimitable distances beyond the horizon the proper place from which to view it is near the north door from there a true estimate can be formed of the delightful perspec tive of the coasters and fishing craft both inshore and in the offing the sky is packed with clouds and films of vapor each of which disseminates either the golden yellow of the sun or its ruddier rays a faint purplish summer haze broods over the sea on the horizan the distance is very delicately indicated by the yawl in mid distance and the two tiny specks beyond the slight touch of red between them and the tenderly drawn broader line of ruddy yellow one must 0 rear the canvns 10 see these give with great knowledge of effect and skill in ex ecuting them an immensity of expanse and light standing away again to the left the reader will be able to appreciate r not only the extreme ot aged of the sur face but the exceedingly beautiful blend und float of the colors of the sunlight and of the sky as well that pervade the fore sea he will also notice that their monet ony is charmingly checked and varied by the interception cf the hulls and snails of the various craft that dot the surface this admits of the local colors of the ves sels tempered as these are by the slight haze and the light and color of the zeniths to be reflected in the water and at the same time admits of their being blended anto that beautiful pearly bluish purplish eray which gives to the almost ungainly hulls a dreamy light reflecting grace of outline and mass that makes their forms so perfectly harmonious with the restful ness and eee of the whole scene the ficture might have been called a sum mer calm for the wide flat troughs in eaove indicate tuat there is nothing to sreak the surface stillness but the slight undulations that at last ripple over one another as they near and are retarded by the beach on which the spectator stands pah 84 a quiet corner in laren by rans a langeveld laren this pic turesque quiet little town among the sand dunes has become since the death of mauve who lived and painted there as great a center and one almost as classic in the eyes of young dutch painters as barbizon itself this jand scape is a rather daring effort for a young painter the sky is full of piled up clouds on the left and to the right and over that part of the picture a splen did stretch of brooding dark blue rain clouds the whole landscape in fact ex cept for this sudden burst of pale watery looking sunlight is in shadow the sky is very threatening boding another rain storm the distant trees beyond the houses seem still dark and sodden the pools of water on the grass in the fore ground show that the pale white gleam in the sky is indicative only of a reprieve the thatched roof against the sky a dark gray violet and the tender pur pplish gray of the wall are true to the day and the lighting and are very tenderly felt the grass of the yard partly lighted by the reflection from the sky is a very varied and lovely green the shed roof the mellow dark rich red of the roofs behind the trees to the right the fine bold drawing and springing of these trees against the dark brooding sky the trash in the corner and the color of the old stumps from which thease trees have originally peen watersprouts are as if from a very mature reach the man and the wheelbarrow are finely and unobtrusively placed so as to give a human touch to the otherwise too lonely scene the dark green vine clambering sy the gable on the left the gray blue of the windows and the russets and reds warm up this corner and give a habitable feeling to the whole surroundings the fine tune of the green of the pollard wil low against the roof on the right and the very artistic way in which the stems of the young saplings in the yard are seen one moment and almost lost the next shows power both of observation and execution that promises weil for the fu ture of the artist no 133 evening by bernard schre gel the ie re this is an extraordinarily mature landscape both in color and style for 2a man of 34 years the purplish clay brown soil and the very rich dark grayish green of the grass both in shadow show a fastidiously refined eclecticism in color and a certain inborn classical chasteness of approach to nature.seldom seen if ever until late in an artist’s career the gradations of this green especially to the right where it gradually emerges from shadow ure fresh and vivid the bark of the bare stems the leaves being higher up and outside the picture of the saplings on the right are most paintably conceived and are both delicately rounded and lighted their gradation being well nign perfect these and the corot like young tree to their left that so beautifully veils the blue space of sky accentuate the loveliness of the silver pive greve of the sky above and add to the distance and illimitability of the rich marbled yellows of the clouds below then look how meaces at f yet firmly all this beauty is achieved first there is a prepared ground of delicate blue and then that is boldly touched and hatched and cross hatched withovt ever being touched with either the finger or the pallet knife and left to dry is not this both simplicity of treat ment and consummate knowledge in one the artist has availed himself of the fact that the prevailing northwest wind off the sea fur where we are is on the borders of the sand dunes gives a land ward trend to all tall slim growing trees to give to the group on the left the grace ful inclination of their forms a grace like that of corot and at the same time the he ats of a rousseau the spaces through which the tent of the sky is seen are so beautifully introduced that they seem to have introduced themselves the rich dark green of the foliage is as mature in color as that of an old con stable or dupre while the beautifully painted light olive yellow and soft gray green foliage in front of it are all his own and what a setting that dark green makes for them the silver gray green of the bark of the stems and the dark ultramarine of the spaces where the bark has disappeared are full not only of an elevated_tender ness and charm but or loman see with what finesse the point where the reflected vellows strike is just faintly touched with the brush how deftly 7 how un hesitating y the brush travels over that lovely atmospheric yet gently ascetic green blue gray of the dune on the horl zon and how delicious is the sun lit green that escorts the eye on to the rich

an inverted core of nard cake resem bling a coiled up waffle filled with ice cream an ice cream had to be developed that would not melt too fast but this kind of ice cream came into being some ycars ago perhaps some of that ice cream is still in existence it never melts it may disintegrate lke a glacier but strictly speaking it does not melt it is made of something more substantial ice cream has been substantialized for com mercial purposes like lemon or black berry vie time was when a lemon pie was cut it would spread itself limply nevertheless invitingly all over the piate now when it is quartered and its sec tions dissevered it stands up as precise ly as immobile and as enduring as if it were made of rubber it firmly refuses to ooze ice cream has acquired the same quality of durability it also oozes no longer in time if improvements keej on it will attain to the same strength of character as the ham sandwich and it may be possible to lay masonry in it or build world’s fair palaces or mold stat uary out of it it is only a few steps from the ice cream sandwich to monu mental architecture it is now your uncommon privilege to go out to the world’s fair and see an apple tree blooming in late october it is not it is true a apple trees tented canopy of fragrant pink ana in bloom white blossoms such as crowns the month of may and makes it in some ways a month more to be treasured in the mem ory than nut brown october but there are blossoms and they are pink and white they are on the espeliee trees in the french garden through the summer months one or the other of these trees has bloomed to the great amazement and dumfounding of fair visitors and one of them seems always ready to take up'the role of floral entertainer when another ceases how this blooming out of season can be accounted for seems to depend on the time at which the trees were set out some of them were placed in the soil at the time they would have bloomed and failing then they have got around to their natural function as soon as they could there is not many of their natural traits that are left to the espalier trees they have been trained to extend their branches at right angles and to send out branches in as regular order as the arms ot a trellis the espalier tree is a per fect example of the subjection of nature to man it even blooms at his command it bears frult where the gardener says it shall and only so much as he says it shall an ordinary be tree would not know its own race looking upon an espa lier tree and should it see one blooming in october it would no doubt turn its back on it as an alien and a freak the putting off people are coming to the fair now and there are lots of them they have put off visiting the fair from time to time in that late comers too much trouble to get started way of to the fair theirs until all at once they have real ized that there won’t be any fair to come to before long and so the trains are crowded the street cars bulging at each end sightseers standing on each other's feet in’exhibit buildings and other indi eations that the number of people who suffer from procrastination in this coun try is enormous punctuality is a rare virtue and one of the faults that some times accompanies it is an overpunctual ity a sort of soonerness as they might say in oklahoma people greatly given to punctuality often have too much they arrive at the station two hours before the train starts and they rie an appointment half an hour before the time set for it be ing usually of a restless and uneasy tem perament they get as much trouble out of their virtue of punctuality as the oth ers get out of their fault of tardiness the two types are always at outs with each bch because they are always neces sarily and unavoidably making appoint ments but all the punctual people will see the fair and all of the other kind won't inertia almost anproaches being

comes in contact with the people and which con cern the comforts and conveniences of the public it has emphasized criticisms and suggestions looking to the better ment of conditions under which the public shall enjoy the ex position we believe these criticisms and suggestions offered in the right spirit are valuable to the exposition management and will be given due consideration but the line should be drawn between the spirit of reason able criticism and suggestion intended to improve the ex position and to promote its success and the spirit of carping criticism and knockingt intended to injure it in the eyes of the outside public and impair its success unfortunately there is evidence of the prevalence of this spirit among con siderable element of st louisans it is unpatriotic unreason able and deserves unqualified condemnation the suecess of the exposition concerns every st louisan it is not a private enterprise but a public enterprise in which st louis has a tremendous stake the men who are managing it are not managing it for themselves but for the city the sfate and the nation their success will be the success of the city the state the nation st louis should co operate with and help the exposition management they should lay aside the hammer of the knocker and should lend a willing hand to the work of promoting its highest success instead of exaggerating ita defects and spreading broadcast false impressions of the ex position and of the condition of the city they should seek to remedy the errors tell the truth about its wonderful attrac tions and give information to inquiring friends which will aid themr in finding reasonable accommodations cofiveniences and eomforts which can be found in the city by all who know where and how to seek them the st

absorption of cina by russia that nation he says expects some day to militarize the teeming population of china and employ it for russia’s own use the united states must prevent this by building a more pow erful navy which will save the flowery kingdom by the force of its unused strength if the unused strength of a hundred battleships can stay the march of the czar’s legions in central asia just think what they might accomplish if their strength were used every consideration of whatever phase says mr hobson ealls for the united states to stand supreme if civilization is t to go forward and peace be maintained it is militarism as exemplified by russia against industrialism as shown by the united states which are the two great opposing forces so then when the militarism represented by a russian army in pekin and industrialism represented by an unused american fieet of battleships cruisers and torpedo boats on the high seas coffront each other well then what then alice per haps can tell us she has traveled in wonderland if industrialism can be established by astral statesmanship we shall have to resort to it but we need instruction before spending 500,000,000 building up an unused navy which shali shatter militarism by metaphysical contact with cossack cav alry we want to know how the thing is to be done nobody denies the profundity and wisdom of mr hobson's proposals

invited guest beeame not only a sean:tal but a nuisance and then some euro pean diplomat was consulted and the rule adopted of making the guests at large official functions show their in vitations at the doors or stay ont here in st louis since the big enter tainments incidental to the world’s fair sce 3 fas oe
began people have appeared to be afraid of giving offense by insisting that only those invited be admitted the invasion however has now grown to such propor tions that many say the most drastic measures will have to be adopted if en tertainments are to be reserved for those only who were invited two foreign gov ernments have already led the way refus fusing to admit people no matter how well dressed who eould not exhibit an invitation at the door you are re quested to bring this card with you will it is expeeted soon appear on every invitation to a large entertain ment the uninivited guest was prev iously unknown ie uninvited guest came into especial world’s fair prominence a week or s0 ago at one world’s fair function there was 2000 in overwhelming evidence it was at the luncheon given by thé board of lady managers to the delegates to the general fed eration of women’s clubs thanks to the un invited guest pandemomium reigned in the board of lady managers building for the best part of a thursday afternoon it was a case of the storming of a social cita del the board of lady managers had issued in vitations to 700 persons the luncheon was recognized in advance as one of the most notable of the opening series of world’s fair society
events the temptation to be present was p parently irresistible to the uninvited guest o it came about that 2700 women attended the function to which only 700 had been invited dismay filled the souls of the board of lady managers they are a resourceful lot tactful and diplomatic but they confronted a problem compared to which how old is ann was but a nursery puzzle for ease of solution how to feed 2700 women with a lhincheon provided for
70u was the problem and on the side how to be courteous and forbearing toward 2000 of the uninvited guest contingent constituted another poser for the lady managers they did the best they could luncheon in vvleced quantities a sort of short commons ration was served to the guests standing sit ting moving about or any old way the corps of waitresses nearly trotted their legs off one member of the board jumped on a chair and earnestly besought those who bad already bees fed to move out and give others a chance great crowds waited on the outside and jammed in as far as they could like successive football wedges on the gridiron to inveigle those in to get out so that those out could get in it was announced that cape jessamine favors would be distributed to all withdrawing from the luncheon it was a terrible time and all becatise of the uninvited guest this 2000 strong charge of the light brigade wos the most formidable assault vet made by tls uninvited guest but it was not the first appearance of that terrifying creature in world’s tair cireles prince pu lun had met the unin vited guest in considerable numbe:s smilin upon the intruder with inscrutable chinese eyes and childlike and bland affability it is not at all improbable that chinese court circles will hear some curicts stories of the creature when prince pu lun has returned to the celestial empire for decorots and ceremonious china has no native knowledge of this strange specie at the swell japanese opening june 1 where both the japanese minister and miss roosevelt were present 2000 people passed the gates when there had been only 1500 invitation sent out so as well with prince hohenlohe of ger many the uninvited guest turned up on die wacht am rhein and bore down on hohenlote with the irresistible sweep of countless squad rons they stared at him with all the abandon due to a knowledge that they had no right to he present at the receptions given in his honor they shook his hands with even a greater free com than they had shaken off the conventions which demanded that they wait f r an invita tion to meet him they made ehverfully reck less remarks about his personal appearance voicing their criticisms with the audacity natu ral to social freebooters sailing under the b'ack flag and whenever they con’d they ate enously of whatever there was to eat at al om where he was the central figure for the un invited guest is always hungry similarly was this world’s fair bete poir numerous at the reception given by the press committee of the general federation of wom en’s club to the delegates to the world’s press parliament in the german pavilion jefferson guards and german commission attaches stood sentry at the doors but the uninvited guest slid in between them flanked herself with the invited guests until her name was legion she ent down the receiving line and grasped the bend of everyone there arrayed exactly as if conferring a distinguished honor she got the very earliest scent of the ceylon tea in one of the anterooms and worked the cingalese at tendants until the combs almost fell out of their masculine back hair passing the ceylon brew for her insatiate consumption then she made a bee line for the japanese room and kept the sweet little geisha girls yum vumming abo.t o their quaint clogs until they erew faint with the serving of fea woman in our hours of ease uncertain coy and hard to please when social splendors make the test that tempts the uninvited guest j a glad and bold intruder thou thy motto get there anyhow thus sings a poetic soul that has contemplated with amazement the antics of the uninvited guest at the world's fair a chant which the post dispatch sunday mayvazine presents with out indorsement as 2 phase of an interesting psychological situation for the psychical prop osition is this if the world’s fair is over run by the uninvited is it not world’s fair brilliancy and exclusiveness that has created the wninvited guest in such vast numbers but that’s another story it isn’t only at world’s fair receptions luncheons and the like that the uninvited guest bobs up smiling the opening ceremonies of the various foreign gov ernment buildings and exhibits are invitation affairs therefore the uninvited guest delight to be present distinguished europeans at the world’s fair face the plague in utmost bewil derment they have not known exactly what to do with regard to its abatement when they invite people to their opening ceremonies they mean to be hospitable and they sincerely hope that those invited will attend and enjoy them selves but they don’t expect persons to come without invitations they hesitate to be over brusque in denying admission to these butt ins yet what shall they do the uninvited guest threatens to crowd the invited guest slap bang off the world’s fair map polite europe stands and wrings its hands hesitating to use them mare effectively against th urinvited guest and unless you make every man and woman show a ecard of in tet w is the uninvited guest to be idengiied and properly dealt with the male of tle species is presentable enough he almost invariably makes a point of wearing saved miss alice rooseveit from much contact with the species rut when the president’s daughter was entertained out at the world’s fair grounds the uninvited guest broke in the young lady of the white house her ex quisite gowns her individualized hats all these were too much for the uninvited guest he or she this time with o venzeance fe fs to be kept away from the president’s duughter ihey got as close to her as they eould and now they go about with the most irritating complacency telling the proud story of when t met miss roosevelt at such and such a reception the world's fair has creat.d a monster which it eannot contre it is the uninvited guest av e of every workd’s fuir social event stalks into the giad sunlight or brilliant electric radi a correct frock coat a high hat gray trousers decent gloves even the astonishing stranger who butted im ard hed his photograph taken with president francis and the board of world’s fair directors leoked as much like a world fair director as the stateliest of the blown in the bottle bona fide group and the
et ne emale of the species o this dauntiess temaie she generally arrays herself in smart gowns that would fool the shrewdest lookout for social
shams aid the taces ilu aua ot her they are serene i:ntassive confident regular open sesame countenances true there’s just a bit
of hardness about the mouth and an occasional furtive expression in the eyes but who has time to analyze all the features in a crush the un invited guest has the odds in his favor if his nerve holds firm it is only from small world’s fair functions in private homes that the uninvited guest has been effectually barred thus far a fact that this masterful monster male sometimes oftener female determined indomitable possessed of superhuman assurance defying its creator with saturnine enjoyment of the situation it is the shadow in the picture the skeleton at the feast th vly in the amber the bitter in the sweet tli jignant fairy at the christening world’s fair officials from president francis down shudder at thought of it the board of lady managers dreams horrible dreams of it at night europe's world’s fair commissioners speak of it in awesome whispers the jefferson guard wavers and turns pale at mention of it distinguished folk being entertained by the world’s fair organization feel their hearts sink at knowledge that they must shake hands with it according to plans now being considered a eee number of uninvited guests will receive t spock at certain entertainments soon to take place but that’s another story 2

race horses like judge himes and flying torpedo that would have had no possible chance on a fast track now bob to the front and make the outcome of the race more difficult than ever to forecast 7 witful’s stock has taken the biggest boom since it became settled that the race would be run in heavy going this magnificent px chestnut daughter of mirthful has been a particularly successful in soft

to win the stake in the mud hildreth’s fg mare is the favorite with a majority of the tt horsemen at the track western horsemen think she can beat anything that wears shoeplates the way she will be weighted e this afternoon hermis is the general public favorite on account of his superb form in the great u eastern spring and early summer handicaps s his magnificent victory in the suburban the greatest of all the metropolitan classics was a truly decisive one over the best s horses this country has ever produced irish vi lad the picket and major daingerfield a were among the stars to finish behind hermis in this struggle 2 hermis giving away much weight hermis was made such an overwhelming favorite in the expectation that the race o would be run on a fast track all his best races have been performed on light ning fast tracks the horse has shown x some form in mud he won races overje slow tracks but eastern mud is much dif ferent from the kind that he will be asked to i run over today nearly a l the pecker politan tracks are composed of sandy s loamy soil and water soaks through them 3 fast eastern tracks seldom become sticky t and holding hermis tremendous impost of 13 pounds is going to sit awfully r heavy on him today he is giving away a lot of weight to all his horses and the task before him is a mighty one indeed the horse will have a decided advantage with redfern in the saddle this boy is a masterly rider and thoroughly under stands hermis he rode the horse in all p his races this season moharib’s creditable race in the ameri can derby last saturday entitied the colt to great consideration today he ran near ly as good a race as english lad and the latter would certainly be well though of if he were starting today with moharib's impost moharib is ge ptt ay a lot of k weight to witful and it looks like an im possible feat for a 3 year old to give away chunks of weight and beat aged horses in a fixture of this importance but such things have been known to happen for instance take conroy's victory in the j brooklyn handicap and irish lad's victory in the same stake as a 3 year old bernays and six shooter are bound to go to the post heavily backed bernays jis the best of the pair in the estimation of future bookmakers who have been hold ing the horse at a short all spring bernays is by wadsworth he ran al wonderful race in the american derby o91t i 1908 finishing third after getting away back in the ruck and forced to practically run around every horse in the trace the picket won this anicrician derby but the consensus of opinion among experts at the time was that bernays would have beaten him with an equal 4 iishare of racing luck figuring on this particular race bernays holds hermis safe as the latter has never shown that the is a 10 pound better horse than the picket bernays was quite as good a 13 year old as the picket at even weights hermis certainly has quite a contract on this hands when he attempts to give the respess colt 30 pounds and a beating in j the bargain race is between witful and colonial girl this is the way i figure it sald dinks i parrish the noted allround sportsman 7 and horse fancier hermis

have seen her win in it f in st louts and when she ran second to muresea in mud in the california oaks her owner cried stop thief for six months muresca wax a grand mudder then never mind about

it is difficult to persuade oneself into ratefulness over the information con cerning coffee which brazil's commis stoners have brought to the fair for the american delectation and edification true we have heard it said often that this so called java and mocha which we drink comes neither from java nor from mocha but may have originated anywhere but to an extent at least we have discounted such statements and have assured our guests confidently at the breakfast table that the morning bever age is indeed the real thing a genuine dave and mocha biend the last lingering superstition on the subject goes glimmering after a short stay tn the brazil building directly over the main entrance are found these sig mifcant figures on coffee exports cover ing the years between july 191 and july 1903 brazil 16,246,000 bags other countries 3,342,000 bagma the following amplification of the figures is etill more disturbing bxports from brazilian ports santos 20,000,000 bags rio janeiro 5,149,000 bahia and victoria 754,006 from colombia and central america 114,00 bags venesueia 800,000 bags java 46,08 bags hayti 426,000 bags other countries 517,000 bags in the face of java's 43,00 begs of 132 pounds each as compared with the total production how can we continue to be lieve in the long boasted java coffee even though we may have paid the price de manded for the brand and j c alves de lima coffee expert and delegate from brasil to the exposition declares posi tively that we don’t get java in the united states at any price the java coffee is practically all used in holland be said and certainly the amount that gets to new york is only a very few thousand bags at that i have known brasil coffee to be shipped to java and reshipped thence rotterdam by the way ia one of our largest export ports by refsrences to a compilation of coffee export statistics prepared and translated inte english by order of the minister of agriculture and public works of brazil it is found that 100,753 bags went from rio and santos to rotterdam in 1x2 antwerp also received 461,580 baga it is curious to note also that alexandria bagypt in mocha territory took 4,05 begs from brazil shipments to new or leans and new york amounted to 715,309 and 453,047 bags respectively the total for the year was distributed among 142 ports in all parts of the worid so we ars compeied to recognize the fact that not enough real java is grown to supply holland itself and that at least 98 per cent of the so called java and mo cha coffees come from brazil much of it is reared there under the name being originally of imported scei often ac coming to the brazil cormee men large import dealers of the united states will mir with e large bulk of brazil coffee emall quantities of african or asiatic brards seeking individual biends which suit the tastes of the public that taey aim to serve in that connection an extraor dinary fact appears one of the many pe cullarities of the coffee trade different localities favor different coffees you may see one kind of bean in the brazil building which commands a high price sciely because it is in great demand in chicago and nowhere aise has it proved so attractive the development of the santos coffee district of brazil las become almost as significant to the trade of the world as
the development of the canadian nortb west into a wheat growing area will be come not so long ago the brazi coffee was the rio janeiro product and known as rio now the output from santos doubles that of rio and is steadily in creasing while the latter is decreasing the coffee pot of the world or the brazilian coffee territory is included within a strip 1,00 miles long and 30 wide the best of the district is between 21 and 23 degrees south latitude and 3,00 feet above the level of the sea under these conditions temperature varies from degrees maximum to the freezing point the climate is the most temperate on the globe at the elevation the occasional frosts are not sufficient to blight the trees but the cold suffices to kill the destructive in sects that damage coffee crops in the low er and hotter areas the land is a dark rich purple loam of the superlative fertil ity necessary to nourish coffee trees which would soon wear out a less fecund soil at that fertilizing must be done regular ly to insure safe and good crops from a series of enlarged photographs taken in the santos district the visitor to the brazil building gains an idea of the way coffee is grown and of the external appearance of the coffee belt careful re productions of the tree at various ages and of scenes on different plantations in cluding illustrations of the processes such as drying shelling packing and roast ing are in the collection of views the machinery used is displayed in the liter al and will soon be in operation the bean will be separated from its husk the vari ous kinds and sizes of beans will be classi fied and the roasting will be done before the eyes likewise and what is more palatable coffee will be made and served a la brazil the gentlemen from brazil while they pooh pooh the notion that alleged mocha and java is such in fact offer some encouragement they declare that any good healthy coffee bean if properiy roasted and ground will make excellent drinking coffee if the cook but knows how to prepare it this is more or lees of a slap at the average cook but mr de lima makes the statement without any reservation whatever evidently be lheving that few have mastered the art of making coffee ho weil then you ask him what are the essentials to good coffee first as i told you the bean must be a good end healthy one not necessarily large after picking it must be well dried it should then be kept air tight in order to preserve the aroma for at least two years though it usually fs sold when a year old then it should be roasted until the ofl appears upon the surface causing it to glisten and finally it should be ground fine the finer the better from this point of course it is up to the person who mekes the coffee what you call the drip method should al ways be followed the ground coffee should be put in a bag at the top of your pot then you take your water the water should be perfectly clear and pure and when it is exactly at the boiling point you pour ft into the bag and let it drip slowly through now the usual trouble is that cooks do not take enough care the water must not be allowed to boil hard it must be exactly at the bubbling point and it must be pure then it should be poured through only once and the coffee should then be served as soon as posai bie

instead of group numbers they desire name of article in inscription don’t like the paris plan executive commissioners asso ciation takes up question and probably will protest if ac tion is unfavorable exhibitors at the world's fair to whom awards will be made desire that such medals or diplomas as may be given to them should state in plain terms for what the award is made rather than that the inscription should give the group and ex hibit numbers only th executive committee of the ex ecutive commissioners association has taken the matter of the inscriptions into their hands for the benefit of the indi vidual exhibitors of their respective states and have recommended to the executive commissioners association the adoption of a resolution calling for immediate ac tion 2 it seems to be a cise of whether amer ican or french methods shall prevail in the matter of inscriptions on the medals and diplomas to be awarded by the louis jana purchase exposition the exhibitors are against the french innovation and for the maintenance of the american precedent by the st louls world’s fatlr the french innovyation as the for eign method of inscribing the medals is called consists of designating the award to have been made in a certain group and exhibit number exactly according to the catalogue of exhibits the exhibitors claim that this method is quite unsatis factory for many reasons the main reason advanced against the french plan is that it is necessary to preserve the catalogues and that they must be continually referred to cata logues get lost and then they say it will be difficult to ascertain for what the medals were awarded what the prize winners want is for the medals which may be given them to contain in plain terms for what they were awarded favor the chicago method if the prize was for boots and shoes the sxhibitor wants the medal to eay so and 10t merely give a group number tn which night be some other exhibit of an entire y different nature this was the method n vogue at the columbian exposition at thicago and proved to be entirely satis actory according to the exhibitors cre nm contrast to the innovation adopted at he paris exposition of 1900 at the pel ld of the executive com nittee of tha executive commissioners ssociation at the new york state build ng yesterday a resolution was recom nended to be referred to a committee of hree by the executive commissioners issociation asking that the superior jury requested to advise the exhibitors as o how the medals are to be inscribed nd if the french innovation is to be lecided upon that they be allowed to of er a protest the resolution in full is as ollows resolved that the 2 gee tt of the uperior jury be respectfully requested to onvey without delay to exhibitors receiv uf awards as to the procedure which rill be followed in the matter of inscrip ion upon the diplomas and if this as roposed is to be a departure from amer can precedents and adoption of the rench innovation of 1900 opportunity be fforded all exhibitors for remonstrance ith reasons therefor it is quite likely that the resolution will ave favorable action by the association thich meets to morrow the association 3 acting in the matter for the benefit of he individual exhibitors from their re pective states

numerons opportunities for instruction and en joyment should be accepted generally during the next thirty days first that the purpose of the exposition should receive as flattering fulfillment as possible second that the knowledge seeking majority of the public should acquire full benefit from the advantages offered as an educational enterprise of the highest and most practical type as a philanthropic institution the exposition de serves recognition in attendance as a disburser of innumerable benefits it appeals to the personal in terest of all who are able to see it the generous endowment in connection with the variety and quality of the displays and with the magnitude and charm of the spectacle urges upon the public as closing day draws rapidly near the desirability from an individual standpoint of at tending and studying the exposition the enter prise was created for enlightenment and progress and the management has no wish more deep than that the extraordinary educational advantages should be realized by the people after closing day the value and importance of this iuternational university will grow steadily praise of and reference to the exposition and its influence will be a custom for many years the exposition is so excellent in nearly all respects that it will shine as ene of the best achievements of the century these indications should impress upon those who have not yet seen the exposition or who have seen it only a few times why they should at tend often before the close the loss through failure to attend and siudy the exposition is pressing upon those who are neg lectful or indifferent such an exposition cannot be constructed again in many years as even if funds and talent should be available circumstances would be unpropitious besides it is very question able whether an international exposition embracing the entire scope of exhibition ever will be held again as the tendency now is toward special exposi tions to all who may profit from the greatest ex position there is a particular appeal in the approach of closing day __ e __ creditable to every citizen few cities can declare in truth as st louis caa that reform has rectified simultaneously all depart ments of the local government it is decidedly ex ceptional that the application of the best practical standards in the operative part of the municipal cor poration is contemporaneous with the exposure of corruption and the prosecution and punishment of publie criminals nearly every large city is striving at reform and is getting specific results but no other city as far as is known manifests the capacity of st louis in instituting a complete revolution the work of circuit attorney folk shows extraor dinary results especially in correcting popular ideas regarding integrity in public office and consequently in better fitting citizens for deciding as to nomi nees and questions of policy his exposures of crime lay bare the causes of misgovernment and crime they acquaint the public with the schemes and tactics of malefactors they emphasize the deg radation into which such crime lowers the communi ty they show the detrimental effect which misgov ernment and dishonesty have on the business of taxpayers they accentuate crime’s disgrace upon the city they set a value on good government and they foster appreciation of respect for the law and for the oath of office as mr folk impartially and fearlessly has con tended against crime and criminals the courts have maintained their dignity in a manner commanding satisfaction among citizens the police department has given better protection and the wells adminis tration has been establishing system in all branches of the government carrying on permanent improve ments and making standards for the preservation of efficient management there is not one important department which is not better in all respects mayor wells has impressed upon city employes that municipal affairs have to be conducted in ac cordance with business rules and therefore stand ards exist in all departments he has impressed the sentiment of the new st louis citizens see the city's finances collected and invested rightly they are pleased with clear water with additions and al terations to public buildings with street and sewer improvements with embellishments in the parks with improvements in the fire department and with other public work the results of good gov ernment are perceptible these changes have been going on steadily for nearly four years under the direction of circui attorney folk and mayor wells all officials and em ployes have performed their duties with a sincere feeling that reform and good government are the means whereby st louis is to take rank among the municipalities of the world as a model municipality whereby disgrace is to be wiped out and the city get the esteem which it deserves to have this general betterment is not only an advertise ment and a great benefit for the whole city but it is also creditable to every citizen regardless of his party affiliations the thieves oath and the mu nicipal moonlight are not forgotten either here or at large but instead of being humiliated with de rogatory satire from strangers citizens are now gratified with praiseworthy remarks from visitors upon the work of circuit attorney folk and mayor wells upon the results of thorough reform every citizen perceiyes the remarkable change and is highly pleased and if he is more loyal to himself and his city than to other persons or organiza tions he considers it to be his duty to vote for nomi nees who will stand by and enlarge reform 9 ___ the last month november is the last month of the world’s fair it is hard to believe that the magnificent spectacle which has interested and entertained 16,000,000 vis itors in which influential world’s congresses have been held which has made a deep impression on thinkers and inspired the people is to pass away in thirty days to all of us it should be a spur to think that the educational opportunities are to be offered for only twenty six days the arrival of november brings home thé certainty of the end and naturally makes all feel more heartily the great value and charm of the exposition there is much satisfaction in the confidence that the enterprise has fulfilled its exalted mission the people are more enlightened more liberal minded more energetic more hopeful and better satisfied the progress of the world has been on display for six months and there is no question that it has had a potent influence upon the representatives of for eign governments and upon men of learning and affairs as well as upon the people of this country the exposition was projected along educational lines and that the intention has been realized is acknowledged by all visitors particularly by visitors of experience and knowledge the exposition makes its appeal for twenty six days in november it is a pity that sunday cannot be counted to all persons who seek instruction who wish to acquire a true general knowledge of the people of all countries and of the state of civilization in all parts of the earth it is expected that at least 4,000,000 visitors will enjoy the exceptional advan tages in the last month but it is hoped that the at tendance will be much targer than the estimate as the exposition is not conducted for financial
he ts ee profit but for the benefit of the common people and especially for the good of the south the southwest and the west its educational opportunities ought to attract the thousands who cannot afford to travel and can become acquainted with nations and coun tries only in an international exhibition the desire for a large attendance in the last month is not prompted merely by commercial motives but by an unselfish wish that the benefits should accrue to as many of the people as possible if there is anybody in the territory adjacent to st louis who has not seen the world’s fair he 18 advised to come he should consider that the jead ing countries of the world have here the best and largest displays which they ever have made at any exposition that all races of the world are repre sented that the united states government has an inspiring exhibit that the states haye remarkable displays and beautiful special buildings that in the exhibit palaces progress throughout the world is demonstrated n an understandable way that art science commerce and agriculture are exhibited in 4 manner most instructive that the buildings and grounds form a spectacle of indescribable beauty and that the whole scene is an inspiration these instructive displays will become memories after another month now they are assembled that the people may realize greater benefits than ordi narily are attainable by men of wealth and while they remain together for these few weeks it is earnestly hoped that millions will study them and get the educational advantages the closing of the world’s fair on the last night in november is a sure prospect which should set the residents of this part of the united states to meditating upon how often they can visit the exposition and how much they may gain in education __ e __ the president of a st louis philanthropic organ ization avers that women mix style with charity this is more polite and probably more true than to say that they mix charity with
