Last year Witful, a 3-year-old, always gave Colonial Girl Ww pounds and held her safe at a mile, and at a mile and one-sixteenth it was a simple ‘inch for Witful. Colonial Girl is good this rear. 1 see her trainer says that she cannet run in mud. 1 have seen her win in it F in St. Louts, and when she ran second to Muresea in mud in the California Oaks her owner cried ‘Stop thief’ for six months. Muresca wax a grand mudder then. Never mind about Celonial Girl in the mud. She can run in it, but on any track Witlful has her beaten at the distance  *“Witful’s last race was a mile and a sixfeenth at Washington Park with M2 pounds up. She was iast to the half mile, then Sut off, yet galloped home an easy winner by three lengths iv ':46 Thjs means a mile and a quarter in 2:04 that day with 2 up ; She takes up 103 today and is in her eleSi ment.  “tiermis may beat 2:04 with 130 up, but i doubt it. Anyhow, I cannot see a fast track runner from ithe East stand the trip and win in the gumbo here loday. Eastern horses are not xaited to run in this mud. To run in heavy muda horse must bound like an antelope. All eastern horses run iow.. Their hind feet skim the ground. This will not do in heavy mud.  “Witful won the Crescent City Derby up to her ears in mud. She loves !t. She is trained by a master As I see, she } will win as far and as easily as she wants F to. J “Moharib has a good chance, but 1 oy scarce look to see a 3-year-old concede M Witful 17 pounds. To concede a mare who = can run a mile and a quarter in 2:04 is le asking a lot off any colt. ys  “No, I will not bet the laundry on Wit-] 3, ful, but I mean to have a $% spot on CG You will hear me crying, ‘Pull her up, r pull her up,’ ail through the stretch.” TT Will Shields, Hermis’ trainer: Hermis is| §| great enough to win with al] the handicap s of weight and track conditions. z Arthur Redfern, Hernais’ rider: 1 know qT what Hermis can do, and I expect him to | Mg walk away from his field. He worked inj p, the mud yesterday in form to show me] g, enough. T E. R. Thomas, owner of Hermis: I think] fT my horse the greatest {mn the country, and] I will back my opinion. G Cc. E. Rowe, Colonial Girl's trainer: To 7 tell the truth, I am disappointed at the | jon heavy track. I think we would have had a ‘hance on a fast course. Still—-well, watch Ms the race. tT T. P. Hayes, who races Gold Heels: My} g¢, horse is a sure starter in the mud. On the : soft going I think he has a royal chance to I win, and I will risk something on the great R son of The Bard. This horse is a grand| § patna: but the hard track might have] % urt his chances. H Rome Respess, owner of Bernays and Six B Shooter: There is no horse in the woerld Sf can give Bernays 30 pounds and a beating, try and make up your mind to that. L  Ed Trotter: I think Bernays is the best| % bet I have seen. I think he will run over] ! Hermis at the ming Ars T  Chariey Cella: Witful for mine. This ts} ¢ a great mare. and has been under covet \ She likes the weight. the distance and the] 1 going, and there is nothing that has a ; chaice to beat her far. tes  F. Kettleman, well-known owner: Witful is an easy thing in this event. She should c win sure. v Johnny Murphy: Witful is my choice, Ste] is a mud bear, and can carry the welgit v for any route. ¢  Dore Silver: Mud or no mud. the weights] § and conditions favor Colonial Girl strongly. }  ‘I think she can beat Hermis the wuy] § weighted.  Pat Civil: Hermis. why he won't be in the money. I would like a fast track for Sambu, but there are others who can keep in front of the Thomas horse. Witful or Bernays looks the winner. tr  Rogers Hayes: On the soft track Gold]... Heels will lose these kina. Don't ever|°? think he has not his former speed. He will! | ¢! astonish somebody Saturday. oF) Charley Ellison: My coit has a_ fair | .« chance in the mud, but the race is too hard to pick.  Louts Cella: I like Witful in the mud. though Hermis has yet to be beaten. The pubhc will go to Hermis. I think.  Mickey Shannon: Six Shooter's last work | M wus good enough to make me think the Respass stable has a grand chance to cap. ture the big stake, with elther Bernays or/° Six Shooter. : e Prominent People _  Take Boxes. u The unprecedented demand for boxes aid tr reserved seats have occasioned the b lief} ti that a big crowd would turn ou’.
