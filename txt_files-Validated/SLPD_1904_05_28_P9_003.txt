Miss Roosevelt One of Those Who Were Present at the Dedication Reception Saturday.  The Dutch had their day at the Fair Saturday, and there were none to say “‘it beats the Dutch.” For in its way the representation of the realm of Queen Wilhelmina, at the Holland pavilion, which was open to visitors during the forenoon, and was formally dedicated in the aftternoon with Miss Roosevelt as a visitor,  is unique and without a rival.  A reproduction of an old Dutch building of 1601, the time of Rembrandt, is the Holland pavilion, facing Administration way. It is furnished throughout in the Rembrandt style, and the furnishings are so quaint and interesting that they hold the attention of visitors for a long time.  The dedication wasin the form of an informal reception, and lasted from 2 to 5 oclock. G. H. Ten Broek, consul of the Netherlands in St. Louls, and Mrs. Ten Broek and Miss Louise Lampimon, who is in charge of the building, received the guests, assisted by C. Von Kesteren, who owns most of the furnishings, and Y. A. Yeringa.  The most striking thing in the Holland pavilion is a very large Rembrandt painting entitled “The Night Watch,” of the time of 148. It is hung in a room which is partially darkened, and the effect is impressive.  <ttsangijetthaiasnipatinmsanailipaiinil
