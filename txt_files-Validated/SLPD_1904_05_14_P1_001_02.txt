Three hundred and eighty-three orphan gitis, ranging in age from 8 to 16 years, and all wearing pretty white and blue dresses, were guests of honor at the opening of the Belgian pavilion at the World's Fair Saturday. ,  The chiidren are inmates of orphansâ€™ homes, and were especially invited by Mme. | Jules Carlier, wife of the Belgian com| missioner-general. They came to the pavilion in a long line, headed by two very small girls, Jessie Olney and Lillian Kramer, bearing baskets of carnations and roses for their hostess.  As the little ones reached the door of the pavilion they were met and welcomed by Mme. Carlier, M. Carlier, Baron Moncheur, minister from Belgium to Washington, and numerous distinguished St. Louisans and representatives of foreign governments. They formally presented the flowers to Mme. Carlier, and were then taken in charge and shown through the building.  The first thing which attracted their attention was a large portrait of the Crown. Princess Albert of Belgium, holding in her | arms her little son Leopold. The ened looked upon this portrait with great delight and had many words of praise for the beauty of the,crown princess and the little boy.  Under the guidance of Mme. Carlier and Misses Josie Pierson and Rose Hirnbal, the visitors were shown through each of the rooms in the Belgian: pavilion, and all the interesting things explained to them.  Afterward they were taken to the Administration restaurant for luncheon. There they were met by President Francis, who, mounted on a chair, made a short speech, telling them of Belgium, its form of government and little personal bits of its history.
