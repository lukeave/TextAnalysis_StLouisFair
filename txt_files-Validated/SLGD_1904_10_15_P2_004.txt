asm -_ i x PORTLAND EXPOSITION AVOIDS: LABOR: TROUBLE.  The Lewis and Clark eentennial exposition at Portland in 1905 will have no abor unions to contend with and will not be hampered by the Sunday closing law, according to Jefferson Myers, president of the state commission, who arrived in St. Louis Wednesday with his wife. Mr. Myers says these two questions were solved.at an early date.  | “The state commission has been invested by the state legislature with the power to veto any action of the corporation and the federal. government has no voice in the administration of the Exposition.  “A law was passed allowing a Sunday opening, and when the labor unions came to us early in the year and said that no persons but union. men must be employed we Bagh by telling the representatives of the unions that every law in the state favorable to unionism would be re ealed if their position was persisted in. Whe building has been going on for five months and we have had no trouble as  et. > yO Sixty per cent of the buildings are now erected. The state eommission is building these and can veto ahy action of the corporation.” .
