INDIANS FONO OF PHOTOGRAPHS Will Cheerfully Do Any Task Set for Them to Secure Coveted Likenesses of Themselves.  “Clean up. and you will be rewarded with a photograph.”  This {s the household motto for the several hundred Indians camped at the | World's Fair. |  Photography has taken the Indian camp by storm. Every day Doctor S. C. Simms. who is in charge of the Indians, is be| Sleged from morning until night with re| Quests for photographs of first one ana | | then another, from the papoose who has | I just learned toe talk, to the grandpa and grandma. }  Photographs of nearly all the types at the World’s Fair have heen made hy the | oMcial photographer of the Field Colum' bian Museum of Chicago. The collection | ' when finished will become a part of or exhibits of the Chicago Museum, and will  form the most valuable collection of its  | kind on record.  | So far all the Indians have not received | | the likenesses promised them. Yesterday |  | they swoopec down upon Doctor Simms’s  | little office on the Indian reservation and made their demands known. Doctor Simms, unaffected by this sudden visit, turned to one of the young boys of the | Apache tribe, with: |  “Die you clean up the refuse about your | | camp, as I told you to?"  The young brave studfed a moment. | Then he shook bis head. | | “Well, then. you can’t have your photo|  | Braph.”” declared Doctor Simms. “You | | Won't get it until you clean up.” |  The boy went away and worked like a day laborer for an hour, picking up  _chicken bones and litter that obstructed ! the front door of his tepee. Then he re| | turned to Doctor Simms and received a! | photograph of himself.  From cross-examination by Doctor Simms it appears that all the other Indians who had applied for pictures were | | not “good Indians.” They also ‘set to! | work and cleaned up their camps in sur _ prisingly_ short order.  “May I go downtown to-morrov?”’ {n quired a young Pueblo. It seemed to be |  : a relief to Doctor Simma that he did not | ask for a photograph, and his request |  | Was granted. i  “What are those buttons everybody is | wearing?" asked Benjamin Davis, a big 7 Apache brave, of Loc.or Simms, pressing his face against the wire netting of tne | window. j Doctor Simms confessed ignorance. ' | “Well, they're big red and white but-. | tons,” persisted Benjamin, ‘and they say, |  what is that—meet me at the—I forget | the rest. Can't I have one of them?”  Doctor Simms !s considering.  “When is the Exposit.on Company O| ing to give us our pond to swim in?” f|  | quired a little Alaskan Indian boy.  These and many moe questions ard demands kept up a rapid-fire action all yesterday afternoon on the opening of the official complaint office fothe indians at | the Fair. Doctor Simms, who came here | from the Field Columbian Museum, to take charge of the office, will try to make the Indians happy during their stay at the Exposition.
