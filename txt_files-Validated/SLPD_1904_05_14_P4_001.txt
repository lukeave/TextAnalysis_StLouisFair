The ex-senator said, however, that he subsesei quently voted for the Avery fellow servant bill, but the record] we shows that he dodged the vote, oe In the matter of the bill to reduce the enormous compensation | I'll of the excise commissioner, ex-Senator Peers says he was induced to drop the measure by Senator Stone. He says that Stone called him to St. Louis and convinced him that it would not be expedient to reduce the fees of the office, because it formed a convenient fund upon which to draw for party purposes. In short, Stone, who was then in the employment of the excise commissioner, urged that the legislature should maintain the excessive fees of the office for the benefit of the party; | that is, rob the people and the state treasury to keep the parFS ty’s purse filled. Stone drew $500 a month from the office, os-| | _ tensibly as an attorney, the character oi whose work may be inferred from Peer’s testimony. * Peers throws new light on Stone’s lobby work and at the same time puts himself outside of the list of eligible candidates for any court. It is incredible that the people of the|— Eastern judicial district would elect to the bench of the court of appeals a railroad attorney who has shown his willingness LL to act as the servant of the railroad in the state senate. What would he do on the bench? A Science, art, romance, war, ethnology and natural history, as} ¢ represented at the World’s Fair, are all displayed in features of | — the Sunday Post-Dispatch Magazine, carrying out the promise | ™! that the Sunday Post-Dispatch would give its readers full ine formation on these lines. The striking first color-page shows |m how science will be aided by the new researches regarding | 1h radium, to be carried out in the Liberal Arts palace. Gretna rh Green at the World's Fair will interest the young people. Uncle]. ; Sam’s biggest gun, mounted and ready for action at the Fair,| nc will be news to those interested in war doings. And the new ; pictures and stories about the Malay pirates at the Fair will i interest everybody. The costliest guidebook cannot give the] st sisitor anything like this. Many other valuable features, not fe gleaned from the Fair sources, especially on subjects pleasing to bt omen, make this Sunday Magazine unique and the best in the | 7 entire West. ; ai ia ———————#e ~ ne THE WORLD’S FAIR COMPLETE. ” me The announcement by President Francis, Mr. Skiff, Commis. tt sioner Carter and Mrs. Manning that the exhibits at the Fair | in are now practically complete and in place should be given the| widest publicity. . ~ The St. Louis World’s Fair has a record in all respects better ‘i than that of any other Universal Exposition. There is no dis-|t appointment, and visitors need have no fear that they will not a from this time forward, be able to find practically everything] ;, to satisfy a boundless curiosity or interest. Eg It is gratifying also to note that the absurd rumors of extor. tion set afloat a week or ten days ago have been falsified by x | plain facts. Good. comfortable accommodations may be ob-| ,, tained at reasonable prices by all who seek them intelligently. | 4 These accommodations are so abundant that competition has . served, for once, its proper purpose. Only the befuddled and i : invincibly innocent will have any trouble and the police and| : citizens will do their best to protect them. : The Fair is complete, the weather perfect and the welcome : of comfort assured. Now is the time to visit the greatest Ex5 position. I ' ——_—_———__++e—____ § The cost of material and labor in St. Louis is driving a large : ' manufacturing plant to Detroit.

' ANOTHER BLUNDER. : i “City Counselor Bates has given an opinion that the ordi-|) 3 Mance under which the city has advertised for bids on the E garbage reduction after November next is invalid. é Again the city is in the grasp of the Builer monopely. An : attempt will be made to put through the Assembly another t Z ordinance which, let us devoutly hope, will be free from legal infirmities and escape the assaults of Butler's serving men in the Council and House. | ~ How does it happen that an ordinance so important as this > was not inspected by the city counselor before it wits submitted to the Assembly’ It should have been critically studied and not started on its passage until pronounced blameless by the city’s law officers. And it should have been accompanied on its perilous journey by good legal ability to protect it at every stage from amendments designed to destroy its purpose. j But such a course would have been a departure, too radical. f from the traditional imbecility of the municipal government of i St® Louis What! Anticipate legal objections and prov ide. £ $ against them by a wise foresicht? That would be unprecedent-| 4 ed. Save nine stitches by taking one in time?
