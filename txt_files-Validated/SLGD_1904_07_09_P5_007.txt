! ’  DON WHITE MAN’S ATTIRE.  An attempt made yesterday afternoon  to clothe the Igorrotes with the new form  of dress ordered by the war department proved unsuccessful. Three of the savby had been ordered to appear at the afternoon dance wearing the new silk trousers recently made under the supervision of Gov. T. K. Hunt. After having made their appearance in their new er. ments the Igorrotes divested themselves of ail but the Sd strings, and declined to burden themselves with any additional articles of apherst.  It is belleved that the war. department will be ordered by President Roosevelt to rescind its Filipino clothing order. Chief Antonio of the Igorrotes ts highly indignant, and it is, thought that further ef‘forts to force his tribes into trousers will precipitate trouble. At present the savages are stiil appearing in gee strings.
