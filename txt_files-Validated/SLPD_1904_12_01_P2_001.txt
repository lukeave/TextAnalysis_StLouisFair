The police believe they have made ample arrungements to prevent scenes of rowdyism and acts of vandalism at the World's Fair Thursday night. The extra precautions have been taken in view of experiences on closing nights at other expositions; when it has been the custom for the crowds to perform many acts of vandalism.  Eight companies of the Sixteenth United States infantry, composed of 500 men, will do patrol duty. Aside from these there will be the entire force of Jefferson Guards and 450 patrolmen. There will also be 100 detectives on the grounds.
