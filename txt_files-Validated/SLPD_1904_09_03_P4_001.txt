ee | HOSTILE GERMAN PRESS COMMENT.  What is the cause of the attack of the German press on the World’s Fair? The German government has been liberal and friendly. The German exhibits are not surpassed in extent, variety and attractiveness by those of any other for @pri natch. Certainly there is no lack of cordiality in eres the government of the United States, the World’s Fair management or the American people towards Germany's representatives at the Exposition or our German guests. ,  Under the circumstances the comments of the German press, complained of so bitterly by Americans abroad, are incomprehensible. Steps should be taken to learn the ‘cause of the animosity and remove it if possible. Derogatory comments cannot fail ta influence adversely those Germans who are inclined to visit the Exposition, and to lead to ill feeling.  It would be well for the Exposition management to investigate this matter end act accordingly.
