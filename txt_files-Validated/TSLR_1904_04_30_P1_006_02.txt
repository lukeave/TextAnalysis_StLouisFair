“and we must ask that visitors do not attempt to come aboard until the river falls, as barges cannot be taken care of by the Nashville for fear of dragging. I eam charmed with St. Louis and my reception ere and expect to enjoy the Exposition’as greatly as I did the Philedalphia Centennial in 1878 and the Paris Exposition In 1878. These were my last efforts in this direction.  Accompanying Commander Hubbard were Lieutenant Commander Horace M. Witzel, Lieutenant Roscoe C. Moody, Ensign James C. Kress, Ensign William 8. Case; Midshipman Roy M. Ryden; Assistant Surgeon Herbert O. Shiffert; Assistant Paymaster H. D. Lamar, Pay Clerk lL. E. Conner. On the Lawrence are Lieutenant Andre R. Procter and Lieutenant Roland L Curtin. ‘i  There was no fuss and feathers, no receptions, no visitations on the part of the officers and crew of the little Lawrence. Provoked at her inability to keep the bottom of the river from slipping beneath her enchors, she steamed far down beneath the Workhouse quarries and tied up along the Government snagboat Wright.  TO RECEIVED VISITORS MONDAY.  The Lawrence ts simply a little térror. Two hundred and forty-six feet on the water line, with 23 feet beam and 9 feet draught, she can carry enough coal to cross the Atlantic Ocean, if necessary, at a nineteen-knot clip. There are no glinting brass works on her decks. Her guns are as black as her black-green hull. Her two torpedo tubes, with her four white Whitehead torpedoes, could dismantle any ship afioat.  The Nashville to her Is a toy, a plaything. In warfare she and her commander would be alert for battleships to ensnare by false lights in the night, or torpedoboats to destroy in the noonday. Her seven six-pounders can shoot with prize precision sixteen shots per minute and make bull’s eyes at 2,000 yards every round,  Her Lieutenant Commander, A. M. Proctor, is the son of a sturdy son of the Vermont granite hills, the late United, States Senator Redfield Proctor. Her seccond officer, R. I. Curtin, is the grandson of the famous war Governor of Pennsylvania, Richard Curtin, the friend of the Camerons and of Lincoin.  By Monday the Lawrence may condescend to come up and anchor alongside of @ wharfboat and let the public come and tramp over her, but until then, at least, she fs going to cleave close under the lee of the snagboat, and she cares not whether anyone sees her or not. To-day and Sunday the big excursion boats will leave every hour for two-hour trips around both ships.  It is not expected that efther ship will be ready to receive guests before Monday, but the river itself is an interesting sight for visitors.
