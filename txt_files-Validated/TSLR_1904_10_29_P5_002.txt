Filipinos at the World’s Fair Wil) s Insist on Being Decorated.  Not So Anxious to Return Home  c Until the Trophies Promised to Them by Philippine Board Arrive.  “We won't go home till we're deco 3 | rated.” y This was the verdict rendered yesters | day by the native Filipinos at the World’s a | Fair to the officials in charge of the Phile | Ippine Exposition. ,| The Igorrotes, the Visayans, the Bagod | bos and the Moros, are firm in their decision on this point, and they say. they a | will not budge a foot from the Philippine . | Teservation until the medals, which the } | Philippine Board has promised to them r | are forthcoming. n A few weeks ago the natives, from the 2 | youngest to the oldest, were notified that n | they were to receive commemorative o| medals from the Superior Jury of the S| Philippine Exposition, in recognition of r their visit to St. Louls and the World's i | Fair. The announcement was received with 4 cheers that shook the nipa-covered houses s | to their foundation.  No such enthusiasm has been expressed ; since the advent of the natives on the y | grounds, and even the agents in charge i | did not know that the half-savage spirit = of the stoic Filipinos were capable-of s°0 7 much show of feeling.  Permission was secured from Secretary | Shaw of the Treasury that the medals * | could be coined in the United States Mint | at Philadelphia, and an order was imme"| diately dispatched for 2,000, which num' | ber includes the prizes to be awarded to = ree exhibitors in the Philippines Exposi tion.  | With the return of A. L. Lawshe from | Washington on Wecmesday of this week i came the announcement that arrangements had been made for the return of |} the old or homesick Filipinos who might | so desire to the islands on November 15. t Phe the agents in charge of the different tribes made a canvass of the situa1! tion. The reply given was the same from 1] the tiny little Igorrote, who cculd only || lisp an answer in Spanish, to the aged Moro, who sighed for his island home.  “We are doing everything to hurry the é completion of the medals,” said Mr. 1 Lawshe last evening, ‘‘and expect to be  able to distribute the medals before the  _| date set for the Filipinos’ return home.” | a nee ‘| IOWA WOMAN TO SING  AT STATE PAVILION. oe --a ey  EE Rarer |  ee foe aman re eee Ie |) ee ae HP yyE : ; giigekt se , sae  1 Ree a ‘ga Gees  ns eae Bo ex cee as Pi abee ca eae cane: 2h ee cata ; BAMA cc ee bok Gres . ee Sask i ge Ege gS oa es q ges aspede ena. ; ee aD fe ie : eg Te oad 2 "I ie ‘ °  Ls iby: FS Fs bh | 5 ie ‘ : | | 4  l  O02 4 re tre MI8S ADDA BLAKESLBE  Of Des Moines. who will give a recital in  the Iowa building at the World's Fair  at 4:30 o'clock this afternoon.
