P. Verner yesterday | | morning from his little black wards, when | ‘he paid his first visit to their camp on the World's Fair grounds. . |  This is the first time Mr. Verner has | seen his little black charges, whom he | brought out of the African jungles, since | they arrived fn this country, for Mr. Ver| | ner, who waa sufferirg from jungle fever, | wag taken to a New Orleans hospital! on his landing, some time ago, and just returned to St. Louts. |  When Mr. Verner visited the camp yes| terday he found the little pygmies hud| dled together over a camp tire. They | were shivering from ‘he cold. When they | espied Mr. Verner they rushed to him | | and the three of the little pygmies em| braced him. “We are so glad you peed come,” said Luluna, the spokesman of | the party, “for we are suffering from the cold.”  _ Mr. Verner looked at them and voiced his disappointment. Instead of the nice little palm-leaf sults which he expected to find them wearing, they were clothed in | incongruous coats and jackets. |  Mr. Verner pacified them by promising | them a good, cozy house to live in, where | they could have a fire to keep them warm all the time. At present they are Iving In | a tent. he }  The pyemies confided to Mr. Verner that | they had accepted the kindness of their | neighbors on Indian Hill, who had been | good enough to lend them some blankets | to keep them from freezing.  “The temperature in the country they came from,” said Mr. Verner, “averages about 115 in the shade.” ;  The pygmies also complained to Mr. Ver| ner of the rudeness of the American peo| pie. Luluna said that the people did noth| ing but lean on the fence and ask quesj tions, which they could not understand. | “When a white man comes to our counj try,” complained Luluna, “we give them presents, sometimes of sheep, goats or birds, and divide our elephant meat with them. The Americans treat us as they do | our pet monkey. They laugh at us and poke their umbrellas into our faces, They do the same to our monkey.”
