Hymn of the West. WORLD’S FAIR, ST. LOUIS 1904 The following hymn, written upon invitation of the Exposition management, by EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN, was sung by a chorus of five hundred voices. The music for the hymn was written, also upon official invitaticn, by PROF. JOHN K. PAINE of Harvard University. O Thou, whose glorious orbs on high Engird the earth with splendor round, From out Thy secret place draw nigh The courts and temples of this ground; Eternal Light, Pill with Thy might These domes that in Thy purpose grew, And lift a nation’s heart anew! Illumine Thou each pathway here, To show the marvels God hath wrought Since first Thy people’s chief and seer Looked up with that prophetic thought, Bade Time unroll The fateful scroll, And empire unto Freedom gave From cloudland height to tropic wave.
