The social standing of everybody ‘in London is fixed by a.great map 20 fect high and equally wide, -whereon every  A : street is traced in  The Classes and colors. All those in  _yellow are the streets  the Masses. inhabited. mostly by  | the wealthy; next  those in red, by the. well-to-do; the biue, by the ‘comfortable’; further graduations are the “‘poor and comfortable,”’ the  “poor’’ (an presumably . uncomfortable), the ‘very: poor’? and the semicriminal. There is an area half as He as St. Louis which seems to be inhabited by the semicriminal, besides sending out sprays and ‘eanches, rootlets and runners. into other paets of the city. It appears that the realtvestaté agents in London haven't the influeace they have’ in America, or they never would permit such a classification of street®. and districts in which they had lots and biyldings to sell.

Good resolutions seem to be of no account; nor is anything else which we have tried of any account—  Ree Peo intended. All of us un reform cities have smoke abatement leagues; we have an ordinance; we have  inspectors. We: also have smoke. _ St.  Paul shows us pictures of St. Paul with out. smoke, but what other proof _has  she to ofter? We can’t all go to St. Paul to see if she is speaking us fair, and the commissions we send abroad to see things  sometimes inspire us with doubt.
