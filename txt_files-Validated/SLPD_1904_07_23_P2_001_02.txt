_—9———__— GIRLS THINK IT HARD THAT FAIR RULES ARE SO SEVERE  POST DISPATCH WORLD'S FAIR BUREAU, July 23—Stenographers at the Administration building are indignant again— this time for a good and sufficient cause, they clatm.  Not content with compelling them to report at their desks promptly at 8:30 o'clock every morning. the company yesterday posted sume additional rules, as follows:  Eight-thirty a. m. is the hour that office employes must report at their desks, and they must not quit work until P= m.  Any office employe reporting five minutes late in the morning will not be given employment for that day and the time iost will be deducted from salary.  Any office worker who reports late two mornings in succession will be discharged without further notice.  Stenographers and clerks cannot leave their desks during office hours without permission from the chief of their department.  The last rule strikes the saddest blow to the Fair girls. It means an end to social calls during business hours. There will be no more gossiping in the hallway, the tunnel under the Administration building or in the archway.  The girls think that a severe restriction fs being placed on their liberty, and if they were not afraid of losing their jobs anyhow they might call it an outrage.  — —_o—__—_ ete Seer. J ee eee oe
