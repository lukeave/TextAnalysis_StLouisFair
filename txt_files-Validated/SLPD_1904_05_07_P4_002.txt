The Post-Dispatch has given space to reasonable criticisms | |  of the World’s Fair and its management, especially on points  in which it comes in contact with the people and which concern the comforts and conveniences of the public. It has} | emphasized criticisms and ,suggestions looking to the betterment of conditions under which the public shall enjoy the Ex| position. We believe these criticisms and suggestions offered | | in the right spirit are valuable to the Exposition management and will be given due consideration.  But the line should be drawn between the spirit of reasonable criticism and suggestion, intended to improve the Exposition and to promote its success, and the spirit of carping criticism and “knockingt”’ intended to injure it in the eyes of the outside public and impair its success. Unfortunately, | there is evidence of the prevalence of this spirit among @ considerable element of St. Louisans. It is unpatriotic, unreasonable, and deserves unqualified condemnation.  The suecess of the Exposition concerns every St. Louisan. It is not a private enterprise, but a public enterprise, in which St. Louis has a tremendous stake. The men who are managing it are not managing it for themselves, but for the city, the sfate and the nation. Their success will be the success of the city, the state, the nation.  St. Louis should co-operate with and help the Exposition] management. They should lay aside the hammer of the}: “knocker,” and should lend a willing hand to the work of! promoting its highest success. Instead of exaggerating ita} defects and spreading broadcast false impressions of the Ex| position and of the condition of the city, they should seek to |: remedy the errors, tell the truth about its wonderful attractions and give information to inquiring friends which will aid | themr in finding reasonable accommodations, cofiveniences and | eomforts which can be found in the city by all who know where and how to seek them.  ' The St. Louis Expesition is a surpassing triumph and should | reap all the fruits of success. ——__—_—_—_++4—______  A picture of Senator Stone saving Missouri from himself and his frierds might be hung in a conspicuous place in the Mis| souri building.  : ——_____#o_______—_ASTRAL STATESMANSHIP  That eminent statesman, Richmond Pearson Hobson, believes  ~ we must have a great navy to prevent the military oppression  * gand ultimate absorption of cina by Russia. That nation, he says, “expects some day to militarize the teeming population of China and employ it for Russia’s own use.”  @ The United States must prevent this by building a more powerful navy, which will save the Flowery Kingdom by “the force | of its unused strength.”  ' If the unused strength of a hundred battleships can stay the march of the Czar’s legions in Central Asia, just think what they might accomplish if their strength were used.  “Every consideration, of whatever phase,” says Mr. Hobson, *ealls for the United States to stand supreme, if civilization is t to go forward and peace be maintained. It is militarism, as | ‘ exemplified by Russia, against industrialism, as shown by the | United States, which are the two great opposing forces.”  So, then, when the militarism represented by a Russian army in Pekin, and industrialism, represented by an unused American fieet of battleships, cruisers and torpedo boats on the high seas, coffront each other—well, then, what’ then? Alice, perhaps, can tell us, She has traveled in Wonderland.  If industrialism can be established by astral statesmanship, we shall have to resort to it. But we need instruction. Before spending $500,000,000 building up an unused navy which shali shatter militarism by metaphysical contact with Cossack cavalry we want to know how the thing is to be done. Nobody denies the profundity and wisdom of Mr. Hobson's proposals. But we must be shown. |  No visitor should fail to see the great newspaper cascade of the Post-Dispatch. It is a free and instructive exhibition and  . Mustrates human progress as well as anything that ean be viewed at the greatest Exposition. —_—_e+o-—__—_—_ W. J. ROUSE, HE DID IT. ~ —, The man who conceived and first proposed the Louisiana  Purchase Centennial Exhibition has at last disedvered himself. He is Mr. J. W. Rouse, editor of fhe Monroe City Democrat.  It seems that Mr. Rouse was greatly disappointed when Congress designated Chicago for the Columbian Exposition, but immediately began the agitation for the celebration in 1903 of the Lousiania Purchase. He advocated this in the Bucklin Herald, being then editor of that paper, and other Missouri papers commented favorably on the proposal. The Missouri Presa Assotiation, in session in Kansas City, Jan. 20 and 21, passed a resolution, drafted by Mr. Rouse, recommending the holding of an exposition in St. Louis, and pledging the members to agitate the question. Then the metropolitan press woke up, as is #ts habit when pricked by the pens of rural genius, end made a great noise about it. The noise was so loud that it made even D. R. Francis and his hundred friends see it as a good thing, and they went to work. And so it came about that the Ainus are keeping house in the west half ef Forest Park, the Iyorrotes’ press agent. is making the ghost of Ananias blush, and the entire area round about Skinker road contains pretty much ail in the world that is worth seemg.  It is a far ery from W. J. Rouse to the hairy man from  _ Japan and the Patagonian giant, but the connection is estab lished by Mr. Rouse hi nself and—honor to whom honor is due.  Since it is a moral maxim that a Fact must be credited with  ah that fows from if, vo Mr. Roule.muet be cruiiied with Oe .
