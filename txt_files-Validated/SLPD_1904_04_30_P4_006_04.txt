Following is the adaress of Secretary of War William H. Taft:  : HEN one sees the expense and the  W effort and the energy necessary  to make the Exposition, the open ing of which we celebrate today, it 1s  natural to doubt whether the good is com mensurate with the cost. In less then a __ year this city of magnificent structures wiil  have disappeared, this collection of every_ thing from everywhere will have been dis _ ®ipated. and nothing will remain but the  _ * Site where it was, and the memory of its  beauty and grandeur.  _~ ‘he doubt, though a natural one, is omy evident that we do not feel as we shouid the me suing of this Exposition. It is a reac tone in the unitedprogress of  =~ Me YEE Fach nation is here striving to  shot ‘h J Sifice the last great world’s exposition. it has handled and added to the talent confided to its care. This is the  --ygnion of nations in a progress toward high' ‘ry material and spiritual existence. It is  the measuring rod of that for which mytiads of hands and myriads of brains have  + been Striving—an increase in the eontrol _ which mind and muscle have over the in __-#nimate resources that nature furnishes.  From each of the great expositions of the e253 world can be dated the world’s familiarity  _ with some marvelous invention, so qu'¢k ty adopted in our life, that the change that  = it effected has almost passed from memory.  _ Yake for instance, the telephone at the ex position of 1876 at Philadelphia. Those of  as whose memories g0 back far beyond  _* that date can hardly realize, that there, for  _|. the first time, were shown the experiments  __ which resulted in the transmission of the  ra guman voice hundreds of miles and which  e las revolutionized thereby the methods of  Ss ife and business in every community. Not  < Mone in the mechanical sciences, but in  _ the fine arts, in education, in philosophy, fh feligion, by comparison of the leaders 7 sal thought had in personal conference, are t} these steps of modern progress marked.  And while the buildings and the machines nd the congresses and the beauty and the # amor and the pomp of such a celebration nd exposition as this shall pass into memory, and every material evidence disapyear, the measurement that they make of regress, noted as it is in the history of world, becomes a benefit to mankind,  @ value of which cannot be exaggerated.  ’ reduces the size of our world in that it ‘ ws all nations into one small locality a time, but it increases enormously the  ‘eney of those engaged in carrying on a} yorld’s progress, by enabling each to : r the berefit of the other's work.  ; NEW PROBLEMS HERE.  kizg to-day on behalf of the Presi ie the United States, I cannot but resah =: admirable and discriminating adfre; ich he delivered here a year ago -apen «historical and political signifi&% ‘that great purchase of territory  ..t) § @xposition commemorates; how  { “4 + .einted out the tremendous caa 2xpansion and absorption of ge »* * peculiar federal system, with its =e a for the birth of new states, aft, . &® new it was when this goverm ’)\ and yet how quietly suc “ 288: + Dat its operation, util now tt  _#2em. 6 3 Ht as to Involve no surprise  : oe ad..irat ‘ all.  : lam st m** be pardoned if ! invoke aS attention ~* et that we have at this, oe the cent of the purchase of Louis sha, enn Ype\ another and a dif : _ ferent icn = xpansion, which in-|  : volves. the «x “yon of other and different  = — from . se strasented in the Lou +S jes Purchas¢ day have been forced = pons er “our seeking, and they  Ss must be golved "Bh the same high sense  Une of duty, the saniifeatiessness and cour = °° with which Oudincestors met the very  aS startling problems §at were presented by the addition of thisyide expanse of terri Sigel A ia bt, ed probably will not. — a canter Btatehood upon  aS . dig _tertitery is Zobable.
