TO POST-DISPAT-CH By De Forest Wireless Telegraphy.  POST-DISPATCH WORLD'S FAIR BUREAU, July 2.—An admission of % cents will be charged to hear the first great massed band concert at the Fair in Festival Hall Saturday night.  The three bands—Weil’s, Fanciullis and the Boston band—which usually give free concerts on the plazas, will be united in the hall for the great concert.  There will be 150 musicians.  During the evening the plazas will be without other music than that of an Indian band in the Plaza of St. Louis and the South Dakota State band in Machinery Gardens.  By charging admission the Fair officials claim that ihose who do not appreciate music and would be likely to interrupt the concert by ieaving in the midst of it will be kept out.  | “The audience will appreciate the music much more if given in Festival Hall than out of doors.”’ This is the answer givcn to persons who ask why the great concert is not given in the plaza.  The hall seats 3500 persons, and no more will be admitted, which means that many thousands of persons will be unable to hear the bands.  Weil, Fanciulli and Mollenhauser, leaders of the three bands participating, will each lead the massed bands in turn. The concert will continue from 7:30 until 11 o clock.  , ea
