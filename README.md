# Views of an Empire in Space: Geopolitical Entities and cultural representations at the St. Louis 1904 World’s Fair

This is the repository for a digital history project that utilizes methodologies of distant reading and textual data mining to assess how local St Louis newspapers perceived and represented the visitors' multiple spatial experiences of the world's fair between April 1904 and December 1904. 

The fair reflected and reinforced particular cultural representations of the United States and the world. It showcased a spatial narrative strongly dependent on the participation of foreign nations and the presence of the so-called “less civilized” cultural groups on the grounds. Underlying principles of modernity, civilization, and progress characterized the arrangement of the fair grounds. Those principles enabled a spatial narrative that informed the fair visitors’ experience of a digestible version of the modernizing world, one thar necessarily required the objectification and visual separation of other cultures. The use of distant reading methodologies to examine local newspaper articles published during the fair allows us to understand, more broadly, how cultural commentators, fair makers, and visitors viewed the world displayed at the fair.

The project is currently a work in progress for the HIST8550 Seminar in Digital History at Clemson University under supervision of Dr. Amanda Regan.
