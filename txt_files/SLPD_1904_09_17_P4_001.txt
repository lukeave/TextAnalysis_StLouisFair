SSS | ST. LOUIS DAY AND AFTER.  The attendance at the Worid’s Fair on St. Louis Das | éxedetled 404,000. No better demonstration of civic pride and interest in! a great public work could be desired. The number of ad Missions equaled considerably more than one-half the popu- | lation of the city, and though the numbers were swelled by Visitors the vast majority were residents of St. Louis.  This is a matter of greatest satisfaction. Nobody can say | that St. Louis does not hold the Fair first among the ob- jects of popular affection, or that the success of the en- terprise is not heartily’ desired by all St. Louisans.  ‘The event, nowever, should not be allowed to remain like a peak in a plain. Other days may be made as Memorable as St. Louis day. It is possible even to surpass it.  ‘it is an example of what systematic, intelligent adver- tising ard an attractive program may do. The Fair man- agement by using the same method—especially enlisting the active interest of the press throughout the country, can bring up the attendance during the next two and a half month¢ to a level in keeping with the great suecess of Thureday. Put the Fair before the people in attractive form. iat them know there is a Fair and what may be seen there. Persistence tn good advertising will bring the desired re sult.  ——_—_—__—_ +e _____  Tt i€ a joy to the Emperor of Germany to get up at 6 a. m. Tt ja @ sotfow to the average American living in town.
