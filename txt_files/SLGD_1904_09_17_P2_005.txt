MEXICO CELEBRATES INFORMAL RECEPTION AT PA. VILION PROVES TO BE EN- JOYABLE AFFAIR.  The flag of Mexico waved proudly in the breeze yesterday afternoon in honor of the anniversary of the independence of Mexico, although the celebration was otherwise not what had been planned by the countrymen of President Diaz. It was not the date ef the anniversary which occurred a few weeks ago, the celebration in honor of the event being at that time informal because of the absence of several well-known Mexicans who had been ex- pected to take part in it. And so yester- day the guests who were expected to ar- rive, among them the Mexican minister, were not present 4nd the affair was again more or less informal.  But one has only to step within the portals of the beautiful Mexican pavilion and be welcomed by Commissioner Gen- eral ng a oe Nuncio and other members of the Mexican commission to know that an informal ch yr at the building is one of the kind that must not be missed.  The Mexicans took advantage of the op- portunity to present handsome souvenirs of their country to all guests, among them being President Francis and other mem- bers of the Exposition company.  The many foreign jurors who are in the city were among those who called during the afternoon and members of the scien- tific congresses were much interested in the beautiful display of the products of the sister republic.  The Mexican band gave a coneert which was much enjoyed and was obliged to play many encores. Refreshments were served in the usual lavish style at the pavilion and the occasion was in efery way a pleasant one. Among the guests were many of the representatives of South and Central American countries and society representatives ge Mate present at other receptions during the afternoon.  a DNET Sema BE:
