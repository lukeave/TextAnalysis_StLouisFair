Three members of the party of 194 Chi- nese brought to St. Louis for exhibition ares nding tee and closely guarded wnder  eavy bond at the World’s Fair grounds, attempted to make their escape at 8:30 o'clock yesterGay morning. They were captured by United: States Customs Off- eer Gazzey and two assistants béfore they had reached the end of The Pike. When searched in the office of the United States ‘customs inspector, over $2000 in United States and Chinese curren¢éy was found in their possession.  The attempted esczpe took place short- ly after the moraing roll call, and created great excite¢ment in the vicinity. The three Chinese succeeded in passing through a turnstile which had previously been “‘doctored"” so that it would turn the reverse way, and before their absence was noted had iningled with the crowd on The Pike and were passing rapidly down that thoroughfare. When overtaken by the customs officer they made no resist- ance, but stated that they did not pro- pose to be penned in the inclosure pre- pared for them. :  The customs officers said yesterday that, although they anticipated no further at- ter:pts at escape. the vigilance of the guards would be doubled. They claim the escape was supervised by a toreign at- tache of a near-by concession.  The Chinese are not naturalized, and are kept under sharp surveillance by United States customs officers. The concession-: airés are under a bond of $105,500 to pre- vent the escape of the Chinese nuw at the concession.
