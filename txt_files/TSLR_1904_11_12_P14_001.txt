SEE PIKE BY GASLIGHT. Young Filipinos Steal Away to View Exposition Unhindered by Es- corts—Guard Spoils Jaunt.  Several young igorrotes, who started on an exploring trip of the World's Pair last evening, to see the Pike by gaslight, were despoiled of their pleasure quickly by a Philippine Exposition guard, who took them in charge and returned them to the village. "  Governor Hunt hus at all times matin- tained strict discipline over his people, and they have never been allowed to go about angat him or one of his assist- ants. When the guard saw them unac- companied his suspicions+ were aroused, and he promptly escorted them home, The Igorrotes escaped from the village by climbing the high bamboo fence.  When questioned as to their reason for Stealing away, they said that some of the Members of the party, who are leaving to- night for Manila, wished to teke a fare- well look at the Pike “by gaslight.”  A few of the older and homesick Fill- Ure have secured the consent of the zovernment to return home, and they will depart to-night in charge of Mr, Petit of the Igorrote village. All the other na- tive Filipinos will remain in St. Louis un- til about December 11. =
