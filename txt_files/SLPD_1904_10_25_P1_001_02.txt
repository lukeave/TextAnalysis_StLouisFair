The airship alighted at 2:50 o'clock \‘ near MeReynolids’ grain elevator, south of East St. Louis and epposite the foot of ; Choute2zu avenue. The epernter reached the ground safely. ‘  The Baidwin airship, safled over the |! World's Fair at 2 o'clock this afternoon.  Without warning and without any sort | ' of announcement that a flight was to be ! attemmed, the ship with which Thomas S. Baldwin of San Francisco will compete for }! the grand prize of $160,000, came suddenly |! into view, mounting into the heavens from j 1 the Aeronautic concourse back of the Ad- {5 ministration building. ‘  Few saw it until it was over the Ad- ministretion building.  The amazement which its appear- || ance caunsed could pet have been enuch | greater if a battleship had suddenly || appeared in the air.  “An airship! An airship!’ was the &-y which went ub. ;  it was fiving low at that time, and was |; net seen except by persons on the west- ward side of the grounds.  At the cry of "airship" everybody rushed |) from the Adminietration building~and from }! the national pavilions east of the’ Adminis- |. tration building. ‘  Looking aloft they saw a cigar-shaped || bag supporting a frame work, in the center A of which was a man who was supposed to |; be Thomas 8S. Baldwin, inventor of the ship, but who, it was later learned, was A. Roy Knabensechuh, his assistarit.  The ship was sailing due eastward. and in a moment had passed over the national pavilions.  It*rose higher into the air as it sailed and either hecause it was caught by a cross current of air or because it sulted the curpose of the man it was carrying to steer in another direction, it yeered to the northeast and held that direction until, from thé Administration build'ng. it ap- peared to be hanging over the Pike. |  Betting on the first race at Delmar racetrack, adjoining the World's Fair on the northwest, was stopped by the ap-— prrition, and beokmakers followed their, prospective patrons out of the betting | ring to “rubber” at the airship. i  Tne monster airship passed out of the | Fair ground over the west fence of Forest j Park at 1:55 o'clock, going in a southeast- erly direction, and was at that time abot one-half mile above the earth  At that time it was salling with the wind, and was @riving backwards. Bald- ; win's propeller is placed in the forward end | of the machine. -As it passed slowly out of the Fair grounds the propefier was in the rear.  After the ship left the grounds, moving slowly over Forest Park. it was seen to revolve slowly on its axis. It drove ahead a few feet then slowly revolved again, ia | propelier still fn the rear, and then drifted on with the wind.  To persons who were watching the ship 3 through glasses it appeared that something went wrong as the ship was about i the Transportation building.  Knabenschuh seemed to be trying to re- i] pair the damage, whatever it was He- waved at the people back at the aeronautic i concourse and the signal was understood |; to mean that he was all right.  It became apparent, bowever, that he! could no longer steer the ship, which was |, carried eastward by the breeze. ;  Perey A. Hudson, assistant custodian of the seronautic concourse, saye that Kneb- | ensebuh had full control of the vaive cord { and would be able to descend when he) round a suitable place.  At the height of a half mile the ship | was of a Nght color and seemed translu- cent in the sunlight. | A large crowd afoot and in automobiles | followed it through the World's Fair Grounds and out into Forest Park. This; Was not difficult, as the ship did not seem |  to be tiaveling faster than four or five miles an hour. In one of the automobiles | in tho trafl of the airship was Inventor | Baldwin | At 2:15 the ship appeared to be about | over the intersection of Grand and Chou- leau avenues heading east. It was about | 2 feet high.  _ At 245 e'elock the airship was hover- img ever the city, about 4500 senth, be- tween Brendway and the river. /AERONAUT AND WIFE  : WATCH START FROM THE AERODROME | While there had Seen a0 announcement
