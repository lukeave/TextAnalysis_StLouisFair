O, realm of the fairy!  oO, gaye ya comes true! I catch in the darkness,  Swift vision of you,  In radiant light  Thy pinnacles rise And â€œkam on the skies,  "Neath whose roseate arch bee minarets march,  nd thy domes silver bright Enkindle the night,  While the soft shadows die ae the quick star-points fly. 'Tis a city of angels  The vision unbars Barage of St. Louis,  And pictured in stars.  E &. BE. R
