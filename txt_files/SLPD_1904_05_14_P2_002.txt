But he has no erifclaying ano. If there are any other new inven-| th ions displayed at the Exposition that the] co Shah can use, 1 shall send one of each to tim.” th The Shah—Muzafereddin—will not come th o St. Louis during the Exposition. Possi- | Aj yy the crown prince, the governor of} w laebrs, will come, according to Mr. Kele- cian. ne  The commissioner says the Shah would] of ike to see the Exposition, but would not] ' make the trip because it would necessitate t trip across the ocean. He says that he Muzafereddin does not like to travel by ; Ré water. it is related that when he went|]in to Paris and London during the Paris Ex- } position he had a warship on either sidej ,. of his royal craft to protect it on the be water. m™  eae Ww  JEFFERSON GUARD belonging to|y, Company C was illustrating his objec- | o tions to the system of compelling | f members of that company to e&t at a cer- “ tain restaurant just outside of the Exposi-| 9; tion gates. ; si  “IT had supper there last night and break- | b fast tliere this morning,” he said, ‘‘and the; t walters punched $1.60 out of my meal ticket. o  “That shows what «a good chance I have. | W  “I get $1.63 1-3 a day salary and so, if I} ti eo without any dinner and get somebody | ™ else to pay my laundry bills and inciden- |W ial expenses and furnish me with cloth- t ing, . will be able to save almost a nickel it every day.”  —_ Si  RINCE PU LUN’S age is officially | © p given as 30. a Many who have seen the prince | tl  have remarked that he looks younger. ir  According to Theodore Hardee of the Exposition department of Oriental ex- ploitation, if the prince’s age is officially given as 30 he is only 29. te  “It is a Chinese custom,” says Mr. Har-j , dee, “to say that a child is one year old | ¢: as soon as he is born, and when the child] p is a year old by our reckoning he is said] h to be 2.” :  RESIDENT FRANCIS delighted the : p Kentuckians in the party making the] ¢ tour of inspection of exhibits by stopping in front of the Kentucky ex- hibit in the Palace of Education and pointing to the display from Madison} County. 4  “Thats my native county,”’ said the] » president. : 2  Presideiut Francis was born in Richmond, | 1 Ky.. as Secretary R. E. Hughes, secre-!j tary of the Kentucky commission, was 4 proudly telling the others in the party tor]|~- some time thereafter.  NCIDENTS frequently occur to show the cosmopolitan character of the Exposi- tion. For instance, the manager of one  of the telegraph offices was approached by a stranger, ci, said hastily: “  “What's ihe newspaper rate to Japan?  Jt was given him, and a dispatch to a Tokio newspaper was promptly filed.  ‘A. well-dressed man entered a telephone ‘booth in the Administration building and |dashed out a few minutes later, wearing a look of diszust. A band was playing just }outside the building. ” | “That band commenced to play,” he de- tar 4. “just I started to talk to New | York.”  OL. J. A. YERRINGTON, executive ( commissioner from Nevada, is leoking for a plumber. .  He does not know the name of the | plumber he is looking fer, but he would \like to find him very much nevertheless.  Although one would not guess it from his smiling manner, Col. Yerrington has many  troubles. His bungalow. on the plateau of states is without electric lights and tele- phone connections. All his neighbors on the ylateau have these accommodations, vul ae Bas been unable to get them up to date, al- though they are promised him in the’ near future,  ‘He has not even been able to have the plumbing of the building completed. After the water pipes had been installed, he found that the plumber had fixed certain pipes in away that rendered them inoper- ative,  He sent for another plumber. p  “T want those pipes fixed,’ Yerrington said.  “Lemme see ’em,” said the new plumber.  Cel. Yerrington showed them. | “Me fix "em?" said the new plumber, in- idignantiy; “well, I should say not. | “Why not?” asked the astonished com-  missioner.  “Because I didn't do that rotten work. You fing the plumber that did the botch and get him to fix it.”  ‘And now Col. Yerrington is spending his } re moments Wandering around the  plateau locking into each face he sees in the ‘hope that it may prove to be that of the plumber in question.  Unless he succeeds, Col. Yerrington fears he may be compelled to go without water as well as lights and telephone.  BES tee ae 8:24 A. M. Daily.
