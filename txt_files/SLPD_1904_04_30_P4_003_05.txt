SEC’Y TAFT AT THE FAIR.  The Exposition is so “ that I cannot do justice to it in few sen- tences.  I am glad to be here and delighted to find the Exposition in such a state of preparedness. .  I had been led to suppose that It was by no means so far advanced.  The opening is magnificent; the crowd is all that could be desired.  Natures is certainly smiling on the enterprise.  I cannot compare the Louisiana Purchase Exposition with others without a more detailed inspection; but judging from general appearan- ces, I have no doubt that it will prove to be the paragon of exposi- tions, abundantly fulfilling the promises of this opening day.
