GOVERNOR DOCKERY SAYS VISITORS SHOULD RECEIVE WARM WELCOME FROM MISSOURI PEOPLE AT FAIR.  “Citizens of St. Louis and the entire State of Missour! must co-operate in extending a cordial welcome to World's Fair visitors,” said Governor A. M. Dockery, who arrived at the Southern Hotel yesterday afternoon.  “It is the duty of the city and the State to make visitors comfortable and happy. The genuine, old-fashioned hospitality is the kind that counts,  “First Impressions are always the most lasting, and the early visitors are the ones who will carry the reports back to their homes. Let us receive every- ene with such sincerity that they will return to their relatives and friends with glowing accounts of the Exposition.”  Governor Dockery will participate in the ceremonies to-day. The members of his staff who are already in the city are: Colonel J. J. Russell, Charleston; Colonel Charles L. Wood, Raleigh; Colonel F. L. Lutz, George S. McGrew and T. C. Hennings of St. Louls.  A great crowd will come down from Jefferson City, according to the Gov- ernor’s report. The Statehouse offices will be closed. Governor Dockery says that official business and politics will stand aside now until the Fair is opened and gets a good start.
