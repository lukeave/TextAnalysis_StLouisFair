Magnificent Parisian gowns to the ap- proximate vaiue of a million dollars are in a ruined condition at the aPlace of Manu- factures at the World's Fair as a result of the deluge of Friday night.  It was discovered Saturday that the rain | had beaten through the roof and leaked | down upon a large number of the dresses. exhibited by the famous dressmakers of Paris, each worth a smail fortune and ren- dered them worthless.  That the damage done approximates $50),- 000, including cost of transportation, is | the declared opinion of Marcel Estieu, | acting commissioner-general of France, who made an investigation Saturday. |  The gowns exhibited by the French dressmakers, which have been one of the most interesting features of the Manufac- tures building, are on either side of the main corridor in the angle of the build- ing. The roof is high there and composed largely of glass, so as to enable the dress- es to be seen to the best advantage.  Between the roof and the showcases in which tie dresses have been exhibited on wax figures. white cloth is stretched. which was intended to afford some protec- tion without diminishing the light.
