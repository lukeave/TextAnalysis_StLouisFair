and office, gentlemen's and ladiesâ€™ room, the space will be occupied by rooms fur- lished for the jeu LL uses that will be desired by visitors from the State and their guests.  The exterior of the building will be a little different from the staff work which is to be so much in evidence elsewhere, in that it will be constructed of the South Dakota cement in dark tint. with the porches, windows und ornamentation painted so as to relieve the building of any charge of somberness.  This cement covering is iurabie and per- munent as stone. and is used on several of the public buildings in the State. The cost of construction of the peta will be from $6,000 to $650. The plumbing, elec- tric lighting. sewerage and sas will cost a couple of thousand more, while the interior decoration, including that of the main hall, as mentioned in grains and grasse3, will approximate $5,000.
