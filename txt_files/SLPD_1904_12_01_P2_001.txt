The police believe they have made ample arrungements to prevent scenes of rowdy- ism and acts of vandalism at the World's Fair Thursday night. The extra precau- tions have been taken in view of experi- ences on closing nights at other exposi- tions; when it has been the custom for the crowds to perform many acts of van- dalism.  Eight companies of the Sixteenth United States infantry, composed of 500 men, will do patrol duty. Aside from these there will be the entire force of Jefferson Guards and 450 patrolmen. There will also be 100 de- tectives on the grounds.
