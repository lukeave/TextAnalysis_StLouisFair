Poured through the gateways of the North Thy mighty rivers join their tide, And on the wings of morn sent forth ‘ Their mists the far-off peaks divide. By Thee unsealed, The mountains yield Ores that the wealth of Ophir shame, And gems enwrought of seven-hued flame. Lo, through what years the soil hath lain At thine own time to give increase— The greater and the lesser grain, The ripening boll, the myriad fleece! Thy creatures graze . Appointed ways; League after league cross the land The ceaseless herds obey Thy hand. Thou whose high archways shine most clear Above the plenteous western plain, Thine ancient tribes from round the sphere To breathe its quickening air are fain; And smiles the sun To see made one Their brood throughout Earth's sreenest space, Land of the new and lordlier race!
