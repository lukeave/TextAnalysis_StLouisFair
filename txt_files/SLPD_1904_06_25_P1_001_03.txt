“In my opinion Judge Parker will receive | the nomination, and will receive the sup- port of the New York delegation. The man with whom I talked yesterday was accom- panied by his wife and two daughters when he called to see me, and he did not pretend to represent the New York leaders. I be- lieve that Judge Parker can carry the state of New York. | “This presidential talk puts me in a pecu- ‘liar and embarrassing position. I am presi- dent of the Exposition and nothing else. I} been endeavoring to make it a success, and it is ocoupying all my time. I realize that it would be an impossibility for any man to refuse the nomination for president if it were tendered him. It is the greatest honor which could be paid any man. I wish it dis- tinctly understood, however, that I am tn no sense a candiate for the nomination, and I do not wish what I have saiti to be construed to mean that I am a candidate, for I am not.”
