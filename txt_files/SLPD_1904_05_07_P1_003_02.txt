Mrs. Sophia Weinzeirl of 3S Arsenal street, a good looking, fashionably dressed woman of middle age, wearing about $1000 worth of diamonds, was arrested Saturday afternoon and arraigned before a United States commissioner on a charge of im- porting girls to St. Louis from Europe, es- pecially from Germany, for improper and unlawful purposes.  The arrest was brought about by In- spector Jas. R. Dunn of the United States Department of Commerce and Labor at Washington, and followed the arrival here a week ago of ten girls from Germany.  These girls, who_reached St. Louis a week ago, were lured to America by at- traclive advertisements placed in various European, especially German, papers, of- fering positions with good salary at light housework in St. Louis during the Wor.d’'s Fair to young and good-looking girls. ‘Their arrival here is the first tangible evidence of the reported traffic in girls in connection with the St. Louis Exposition, Laelia has been spoken of in the newspa- pers throuhout the country. It is beileved that a great many other girls from abroad are now on their way to St. Louis as a result of the seductive advertisements in- serted in the European newspapers.
