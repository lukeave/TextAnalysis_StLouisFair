_| Miss Alice Roosevelt led a life from 11 | a m. to 7:19 p. m. yesterday that was : | Strenuous enough to satisfy her father, the ‘ | President of the United States. She dashed | &cross town to the Fair grounds, saw Gov- || ernor Yates at the Illinois building, had luncheon at the West Pavilion on Art Hiil and “did the Philippine concession. Jt was a swing around the circle that |} thorouchiy wearied everybody with her, | but Miss Roosevelt seemed as fresh when Danie! Catlin, Jr.. helped her Into his phacton after the Scouts’ drili at 7:10 as! if she were just starting out. It was a! iypical sightseeing tour In which a great |  | das Was crowded Into very little time  |} Hundreds of people saw the young wom- an’s sWinging atride around the Philipp.ne concession; a pace that made some of the veteran globe-trotters with her Ured; saw. her shake bands with the natives of the Philippines and applaud the drills and dances, and it was quite evident that she  enjoyed every minute of her time.  Miss Roosevelt was enthusiastic over the Igorrotes; favorably commented on other things that she saw in the humen way  | and politely commended the inanimate ob-  | Jects she was shown in the various build-  i ings.  “Not very good,” was her remark of the  | of! painting of her father, painted by a Filipiso, that hangs in the Philippine Government building. It was not a dis- paraging remark, but one that frankly stated her indtvidual judgment of the painting of President Roosevelt.  “Wonderful” was her favorite word of commendation of the things she was shown in the Manila building and the As- ricultural butiding, the word referring par- ticularly to the work of the natives in va- rious phases.  “Where are the people?” was the quess tion that she propounded soon aftem her arrive! at the Philippine concessien, and so she was taken first through the vil- lages.  PRESIDENT'’S DAUCGHTER WAS EARLY KISER. ; | Miss Roosevelt was told her day of jhard work es tly yesterday morning, for she was among the early risers in the Catlin residence at No. 21 Vandeventer place. She read numerous letters and in- | Vitations, and at 11 o'clock she climbed I into the pheeton with Daniel Catlin, Jr., and the other members of the party got | nio two big red aulomeblies. Away down Vandeventer place sped the trim pao hooked to the phaeton, whirling {t over | the level street at a ripping galt, with | the two blg cars roaring just behind. | | } At the World's Pair grounds Mr. Catlin | paid the admissfons fer the party. and in ; | through the srounds went the nervy Uttle | | tet, woth the autos following close be- j ; hind. The first stop was made at the | | iMinois building. where Miss Roosevelt | | } met Governor Yates of Ulinoia She was I, introduced to iim, and spoke to nim |  brietly of his campalgn tn his State for |! , the Republican nominat on. but she is too! much of a child of her father to have ex- } ' feressed an opinion as to whether or no} she wanted him to get the nomination. | | The station waeon of the MeKittricks i! was entered at the Ilinofs building by Miss } | Roosevert and President Franets of el Expos'tion Company, Miss Catlin and Mr. , Markham, and there were two carriages | that were used for the other members of | ‘ the party, the automobiles followtag. ' Away they raced toward the west pavilion ‘ on Art Hill. The driver of the head car- | riage became confused In the labyrinth of | ‘ streets In the Falr grounds, aml went far ! | out of his way. and there were several | § confusing mix-ups before the party : reached the pavilion. , As soon as the station wagon was | ‘ brought to a stop on the south side. Mr. | ¢ Francis opened the doors, and Miss Roose- | ! velt sprane cut. with the others at her |! heels. Thev bad to hurry. I No sooner had her feet struck the walk} ° than she was swinging around the corner | * with Mr. Francis walking about as fast | @ as he ever waiked to keep up with her, | t and the others hustling along behind, but | # Miss Roosevelt had started up the tong4 ° flight of steps that leads to the first floor of the west pavilion before the others | > had turned the corner, and while the rest | t of the party were toiling up the first; if flight outside she was leading Mr. Francis | E @ merry race up the inside flight that
