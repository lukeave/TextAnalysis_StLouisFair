Te x a Many Tongues Are Spoken by Dele- gates From Legislative Bodies of}  European Nations, but All Are Her-|  monious in Common Purpose. |  . PRESIDENT'E EMISSARY r ADDRESSES THE STATESMEN | | Congressman Bartholdt. Presiding at Opening Session, Declares the Dogs of War Will Starve to Death as Re- ' sult of Gathering. j Se (  There wae = babel of tongues Monday | at Festival Hall, but every voice was raised  for peace. C : At the first session of the Interparliamen- ‘tary Union, the use of French. the diplo- ‘matic language of Europe, was not ad- hered to. It was found to be impractica- | ble in the presentation of the greetings from fourteen nations represented. |  Dr. Albert Gobat of Switzerland intro- | | duced Congressman Richard Bartholdt, the} president, in French. Mr. Barthoidt de- | liyered his address in English. Francis B. | Loomis, first assistant secretary of state, | representing President Rooseveit, also lspoke English. The representatives of other nations, spoke in their own language.  Members of the union, believe that this. | the iwelfth session, will be the most im-j} portant ever held, and that as a result -of + the action expected to be taken, longer |  | strides toward peace between nations will ten taken during the next twelve months]. than during many years that heve passed. It will call upon the powers included inj | the union of nations, constituted by the treaty with the Hague, offer their media-}  tion. according to a provision of that treaty | for terminating the war In the East. it | will request the President of the United | States to invite all the nations to convene fin a conference similar to that which con- ; vened at the Hague in 1898, the Central and South American nations, not represent- ed at the Hague, to be included.  A resolution prepared by Congressman Richard Rartholdt, President of the Union for the ensuing year, who presides at the), a&essions. will be presented hy Congressman 1 T. C. Burton ef Ohio, calling for the exe- |, eution of arbitration treaties which will | | probably give the Hague Court jurisdiction |, ito try the controversies covered by the]. arbitral agreements. s« that the court can : begin to act. as national courts do, at the | suit of the complaining party, thus becom- |, ing a self-acting permanent part of the], World's judicial machinery. Clearing House  for the Nations. |  It wil] also call for the consideration of} the advisability of creating, without delay, a Congress of Nations, In which every | nation shall be represented, to convene || pericdically, and as oftem as may be con- |sidered beat for the general welfare, for | the discussion of international questions which current events make paramount.  It fe not intimated that this Congress of |Tnited Nations ought to be empowered to | jspeak with authority at frst. The idea of| ithe delegates seems to be that it would act} jat the outset as a sort of clearing house | | ifor the nations of questions Hable to lead lio war, and as a center at which treatic | lef arbitration, and of all kinds. can be | negotiated and referred back to the nations  for approval and execution. |  Since the twelfth session of the Inter- parliamentary Union was secured for the United States at Vienna last year by Con- gressman RBartholdt he has organized an |’ arbitration group of 1 members in the American congress, who have thereby be- come members of the Interpariiamentary Union. a  The opening seasion Was announced to begin at 10 o'clock, but at that Nour Fes- tival Hall had not been opened The few delegates who arrived at that hour were not admitted, unless they wore their  |badges. After the arrival of Congressman  Bartholki{ all were admitted.  The hall was filied when the congress | was called to order at 11 o'clock. Dr. Go- | | ba: introduced Congressman Bartholdt | without making a speech. Mr. Bartholdt | ' éxtended a welcome on behalf of the Con- |! gress of the I nited States and fel! ‘itated | _ the delegates upon the fact thal M4 natione | ‘were represented. Continuing he sald in! part: “These delegates hare not come here | merely to wee the Expesitioa or out of |  ! enriosity. but because of their interest | in the great !dca of peace. The deiegates are not individuals riding hobbies, but} practical lawmakers, sicthed with great! responsibility by thelr people. They ara] trying to lessen the possivilitles of war - and ther are pledged io do this by creating sentiment in favor of arbitration and tn i legislative work by favoring r-ght agsinet } might. | “National disputes should be settled jn! lene same way that disputes between Indi- | viduals are settled, by arbitration of courts “The most critical know that we are right 1 {In our efforts to avert wars. The goal of | true statesmanship ia the prosperity and | happiness of the peaplé. Peace promotes |} pros yerity and happiness and war destroya | | it. Pnerefore, this congress ise aiding letatesmanship in trying to bring about. peace. “Substantial progress has been made to- .|ward peace by the creation or the Hague | .} Court. The time is hear when public sen- ‘\timent will demand furiher and more de- ‘lcistwe steps along ine path of arbitration | “No longer are there re’igious wars or :| wars of conquest. Eyen the call to arms te defend the honorof a nation is closely acrutinized by intelligent public sentiment.  The dogs of war are starving to death  This congress, by using the strings of arbi-  tration, is drawing away still further their  subsistence.  “The government which takes the lead tn  _} the making of arbitration treaties will reap : t benefits and the plaudits of man- : find. The country which refuses to make :}such treaties will stand convicted by pub-  ic sentiment.” tj lic montimerholdt Introduce’ Francis 8. -| Loomis. first assistant secretary of state, | ee amg OF grt agro paras
