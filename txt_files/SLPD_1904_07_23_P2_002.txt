arr Two Large Parties Entertained ! National Commissioners at | Model Playgrounds. ,  Lady managers were offered a lesson Fri- day in philanthrophy by their sponsors, the | national commissioners. If they had vis- ited the Model Playgrounds they would have seen boys and girls enjoying the best time of their lives as guests of the com- missioners.  Trapezes, traveling rings, horizontal bars and swings were given a test by the young- sters, who kept them going early and late. Two parties were entertained during the day, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon. The national commission- ers paid their admission fees, met them at the main entrance, escorted them to the playgrounds, but ran away when invited to join in the fun and do a few turns on the trapezes.  Commissioner Betts and Miller acted as the reception committee. They had their brand-new carryall at the entrance to meet the children.  “If any of you children don't feel well,” said Mr. Betts, with fatherly anxiety, “climb in the wagon and ride to the play- grounds.”  In an instant there was a wild rush for the carryall. Fifty children were suddenly taken ill. As many as could pile in rode in the fine carriage. For a few minutes it was an ambulance.  Sight of the playground restored health, however, and as the children jumped out one little girl expressed the sentiments of all by exclaiming:  “Well, I did feel pretty sick, but I’m well now.  And the party went to work to prove it. After tiring themselves out with play the visitors suggested a walk around the Fair, and under the direction of guides started on the trip. :  The children in the parties were seiected by St. Louts kindergarten teachers, but hundreds of others will be entertained dur- ing the summer, as the national commis- sion intends to keep up the practice it has begun.
