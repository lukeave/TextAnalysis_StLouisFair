asm -_ i x PORTLAND EXPOSITION AVOIDS: LABOR: TROUBLE.  The Lewis and Clark eentennial ex- position at Portland in 1905 will have no abor unions to contend with and will not be hampered by the Sunday closing law, according to Jefferson Myers, presi- dent of the state commission, who ar- rived in St. Louis Wednesday with his wife. Mr. Myers says these two ques- tions were solved.at an early date.  | “The state commission has been in- vested by the state legislature with the power to veto any action of the corpora- tion and the federal. government has no voice in the administration of the Ex- position.  “A law was passed allowing a Sunday opening, and when the labor unions came to us early in the year and said that no persons but union. men must be employ- ed we Bagh by telling the representa- tives of the unions that every law in the state favorable to unionism would be re-  ealed if their position was persisted in. Whe building has been going on for five months and we have had no trouble as  et. > yO Sixty per cent of the buildings are now erected. The state eommission is build- ing these and can veto ahy action of the corporation.” .
