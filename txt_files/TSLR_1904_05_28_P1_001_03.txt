She made! || no effort to hide her face, and apparently | pre was going on the “What's the use?’ platform. That she was deing so was! ‘| tater demonstrated. | , There was perspiration upon the face of j } | everybody in the party when the banquet- | ting hall was reached. and some of the } |! party were puffing from the exertion of a | 4} raj-d walk and a toleeme climb tn a hot. | sun. It was 1:30 p. m. when the party sat | .| down to the dinner given in the pavilion | -|by Mr. and Mrs. George Markham.

TWO HOURS REST  More than two hours was spent at Iunch- eon, and it was lucky for all that so long a time was taken, for they got the rest that they needed for the visit to the Philippine concession. The two automo- biles were used for the party to visit the Philippiies, Mr. and Mrs. Dantel Catlin  | 50; ning the party, while M’ss Roosevelt  jemped Into the phaeton with Daniel K.  Catiln. He gave the ponies their head and  they swung around the drives on Art Hill  and down to the drives ieading over to | , j the Philippines at a lively clip, and the | big touring cars roaring after them. Miss  Roosevelt seemed to enjoy the drive im-  mensely. '  They crossed by the road above Arrow- | .  | head Lake and came up to the Philippine | Government building. There the party was it /met by Doctor Wiliam P. Wilson, Uni- | | ted States Commissioner in charge of the | , | concession, and Doctor Gustave Niederiein 1 of the commission; Herbert S. Stone, Chief, of the Department of Publicity; Alfred, | Newell, Chief of the Department of Ex- | ploitation; Doctor Wiiliamsen of thearmy and Captain Butier of the army. To Cap- | , tain Butler Miss Roosevelt exclaimed,  gentally: {  “How do you do, Captain?” and to Doc-  ¢ tor Wilson, “Oh, I know him."* 1 - Miss Roosevelt here led the way, with | Doctor Wiison as her guide.

She glanced at the exhib-| ¢ its with a quick eye and shot out her comments short, sharp, decisive.
