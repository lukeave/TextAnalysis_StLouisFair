HEAVY GOING CHANGES FORM. | The great Sv,w9 Worlds Fair hancicap | will be run over a heavy track ric Form on a fast track wili cut no figure in| this contest. The fact that the race 13 to | be run in heavy going has had a tendency | to make the task of selecting the probable! winner more difficuit toan «ver. Hermis, | Bernays and Colonial Girl would have had | the call if the track had remained fast. | Heavy going gives an entirely different as- | pect to the race. Horses like Judge Himes and Flying Torpedo, that would have had no possible chance on a fast track, now bob to the front and make the outcome of the| — race more difficult than ever to forecast. | 7 Witful’s stock has taken the biggest boom since it became settled that the race would > be run in heavy going. This magnificent} px chestnut daughter of Mirthful has been!a particularly successful in soft going, al-|¢! though she can handle a fast track equally | ap as well. Witful won the Crescent City | in Derby in mud up to her knees and she M could always tow-rope a mare like Coionial + Girl in heavy goings. Colcnia! Girl is no} m ‘slouch herself tn the mud, having finished | c: ‘second to Muresea in the Californin Oaks hi ‘of this year over a sloppy track. te Charlie Rowe, who trains Colonial Girl} uj for Otto Stifel, said today that Colontal| £' Girls chances were ruined by the rain, but | 4; horsemen take exception to Rowe's state-| §! ment. Many of them fancy Colonial Girl's} ™ chances on a heavy track. owe picks Wit- I ful to win the stake in the mud. Hildreth’s| fg mare is the favorite with a majority of the| tt horsemen at the track. Western horsemen . think she can beat anything that wears |), shoeplates the way she will be weighted | e< this afternoon. = Hermis is the general public favorite on account of his superb form in the great/u eastern spring and early summer handicaps. | !s His magnificent victory in the Suburban, ~ the greatest of all the metropolitan classics, was a truly decisive one over the best} s horses this country has ever produced. Irish vi Lad, The Picket and Major Daingerfield a were among the stars to finish behind Hermis in this struggle. 2 Hermis Giving Away Much Weight. |» Hermis was made such an overwhelming © favorite in the expectation that the race]o would be run on a fast track. All his best races have been performed on light- | ¥ ning fast tracks. The horse has shown x some form in mud. He won races overje slow tracks, but eastern mud is much @dif- ferent from the Kind that he will be asked to | i run over today. Nearly a!l the pecker politan tracks are composed of sandy s loamy soil, and water soaks through them 3 fast. Eastern tracks seldom become sticky /|t and holding. Hermis’ tremendous impost of 13) pounds is going to sit awfully r heavy on him today. He is giving away a . lot of weight to all his horses, and the ‘ task before him is a mighty one, indeed The horse will have a decided advantage with Redfern in the saddle. This boy is | ~ a masterly rider, and thoroughly under- |< stands Hermis He rode the horse in all P his races this season. ; Moharib’s creditable race in the Ameri- . can Derby last Saturday entitied the colt}, to great consideration today. He ran near- | ; ly as good a race as English Lad, and the latter would certainly be well though: | , of if he were starting today with Moharib's | ¢ impost. Moharib is ge ptt ay | a lot of k weight to Witful, and it looks like an im- | ; possible feat for a 3-year-old to give away | — chunks of weight and beat aged horses in |, a fixture of this importance, but such | , things have been known to happen. For instance, take Conroy's victory in the | j Brooklyn handicap and Irish Lad's victory | ; in the same stake as a 3-year-old.  Bernays and Six Shooter are bound to|: go to the. post heavily backed. Bernays [] jis the best of the pair in the estimation | \ of future bookmakers, who have been hold- ('ing the horse at a short — all spring. | ' -|Bernays is by Wadsworth. He ran al | wonderful race in the American Derby o91t i 1908, finishing third after getting away |. back in the ruck and = forced to .|practically run around every horse in the trace. The Picket won this Anicrician |! _} Derby, but the consensus of opinion among | ‘ experts at the time was that Bernays "| would have beaten him with an equal 4 iishare of racing luck. Figuring on this | || particular race, Bernays holds Hermis }_ safe. as the latter has never shown that ‘the is a 10-pound better horse than The || Picket. Bernays was quite as good a | 13-year-old as The Picket at even weights ‘| Hermis certainly has quite a contract on “This hands when he attempts to give the /  Respess colt 30 pounds and a beating in | | / j the bargain. . ! |RACE IS BETWEEN WITFUL .
