establishes unquestionably the universal 'character of the Exposition. ’ | The magnificent structures whose grace- |' ‘ful lines and imposing fronts have had no |, _peer in architecture or design; the entranc- ing picture that holds your admiring gaze ;}On yonder lagoon and cascades; the de- | ghtful vistas that meet you at every turn, | the inimitable adaptation of the beauties of nature to the achievements of art, clearly | show the skill and judgment that have been | exercised in preparing receptacles for the | products of the world. . | The exhibits of every country and every people, classified as they are in a manner |' |unequalled for clear and competitive com- | parison, and by a system and in an order _that records the development of man and |his accomplishments, bear testimony to the | | advancement of civilizatior, and show that their arrkngements is the result of thought- fut experience and is for the edification of all who désire to learn. | Has the consummation risen to the full ;measure of the ambitious plan outlined at |the inception of the enterprise? Has the llofty sentiment that inspired the celebra- ;tion found a realizing embodiment in the). j picture you behold? Does the exhibition of man's handiwork here installed faithfully portray his progress and development? Does this assembling of the best products of all ‘the ages, brought together in friendly riv- alry by nationalities and races differing in ect and in habit and ideals, form a cor- rect composite of man’s achievements; of the advancement of science; of the thought of the twentieth century?  STEP TOWARD PEACE.  If so, this universal! Exposition !# more’ | than an exhibition of products or even of | processes, it is more than a congregaiing | |of the grades of civilization, as represented | by all races from the primitive to the cul- | | tured; it is even more (han a sympos.um of jthe thought of the thrones, of the student ‘and the moralist. It is ali of these com-! | bined, and the tout ensemble forms a dis- | | tinet entity whose impress on the present }and influence on the future are deep and | lasting. a ; j It will have a place in history more con- | Spicuous than its projectors ever con- ; ceived. For more than a generation to {come it will be a marker in the accompl'sh- | | ments and progress of man. Se thoroughly j} does it represent the world’s cfvitization | that if all man’s other works were by some  unspeakable catastrophe blotted out, the om here established by the oe ree |nations would afford all necessary stand- ards for the rebuilding of our entire civili- zation.  By bringing together sections and peoples hitherto remote and unacquainted, and thereby promoting mutual respect, ft fs a distinct step toward establishing that uni- versal peace for which all rightminded peo- lee are striving, and which the Exposition’s gifted sculptor has so fittingly typified in the graceful figure that crowns the noble l monument at whose base we stand.  The Louisiana Purchase Exposition, held in commemoration of the acquisition of an empire by a deed of the pen, salutes the representatives, executive and legislative, of the federal government, and tenders most profound thanks for the recognition extended and assistance rendered. It ac- Knowledges obligation to states and terri- tories and foreign countries for co-operation and contribution, and makes its obeisance to commissioners and exhibitors.
