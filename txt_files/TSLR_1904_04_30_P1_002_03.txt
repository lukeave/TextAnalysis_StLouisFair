ceeds thence to Finney avenue, and leav- ing Finney avenue at Taylor, goes to Deknar, and from Delmar to De Baliviere, thence to the Fair.  The route of the Chouteau avenue cars will be made to the southeast corner of  the Fair, known as the State building en- trance. At this point are situated the In- side Inn and the State buildings.  The Laclede and Market lines will also have terminals at the State building en- trance.  The Easton avenue line will also use the loop at the Pike entrance. This entrance leads directly into the Pike. These cars start downtown on Franklin avenue, leav- ing Franklin at Leffingwell to Easton, and out Easton to De Hodiamont, from thence to the Pike entrance.  The Page avenue line also originates downtown on Washington avenue, and proceeds thence out by the same route as the Delmar lines to Taylor, thence out Page to Hamilton, and from Hamilton to the Fair.  The Taylor avenue line will have termi- nals at the Pike entrance.  The main line of the Suburban will have terminals at the Skinker road entrance, which is east of the Administration build- ing.  The Suburban will also run its line on Union avenue under the tracks of the Wa- bash and into Forest Park, and has ter- minals for its Kirkwood, Brentwood and Clayton line near the Administration building.  The Rockhaven line of the Suburban will also have a convenient arrangement for entrance to the Fair.  The Wabash shuttle-train service was thoroughly tested yesterday and found to be satisfactory. This service will be op- erated between Union Station and the Fair grounds, and the present schedule permits traffic to depart from each of the terminals every fifteen minutes, but, if the traffic demands, this service can be increased to a marked extent. |
