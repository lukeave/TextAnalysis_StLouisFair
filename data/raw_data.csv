As she drove into the grounds Miss Roose- velt made enthusiastic remarks in regard to ,each object and was in the happiest humor, She was a very pleasant disappointment, for she is much prettier than her numerous photographs show her. Much of her beauty is dependent upon the sweetness of her ex- pressive smile.  Yesterday she was gowned in a coarse meshed linen skirt and coat of Louls XV. style.

Quite a little party met her, Mr. and Mrs. Dan Catlin, Sr., Mrs. McKittrick Jones, Miss Frances Wickham and Mr. Charles Moore. Mr. Herbert Stone and Dr. Wilson were at the entrance with Capt.

The old settlers had their day} yester- day, and yésterday was also the day of the “talking are light,” which shows a number of surprising differences from tlhe tallow. candle of the old settlers’ era. Taking it for granted that the /old_ set- tler Is more than to years old, he dates from the era of the tallow candle, for, it  } Was not until after E865 that the, coal oil lamp came into general use. Betore that time coal oil was sold in bottles asa remedy for rheumatism. The era of the tallow candle was followed by that of the  Spermaceti”’ candle, which was not sper- maceti at all, but a by-product! of lard such as may still be had at the corner groceries. So civilization passed /into the era of the coal oii lamp and then inte that of the electric light, which) on old settlers’ day at the Fair suddenly begins to give concerts or to deliver /lectures when the button is*pushed to turh on the current for the light. |  —_—__ --——__— ,  In the view of certain old settld4rs there may be sueh a thing) as a eivilization too eomplex for those who ure not’ prepared for it. In the Sew of some others there is such a thing as an excess of simplicity. This is my. own view, supported by a dis- tinct recollection of. a set of molds_for the home manufacture of tallow |candles. They represented the most: advanced thought of their era, for they molded haif a dozen candles at a single pouring. Aft- er all the seraps of tallow not available for other purposes had heen saved in some convenient vessel whose odprs were not usually pleasant, they Were re-en- forced with cake tallow: and after the -whole had been heated until it was liquid it was poured through a strainer! into the molds, where the wicks, after.havying been manufactured previously by the|old set- tler’s wife, were stretched on sticks so that they extended through the molds to the bottem, which, conversely speaking, was the top of the candles. | _AS a result of this) process, such of the candles as did not ‘have air bubbles in them came out ready for use, in! connec- tion with a pair of brass or iron |snuffers, Placed in the bottom of the candlestick for use about once every five wothutes, as the wick burned and leaned over)so as to Geflect the blaze and cause the candle to Gurn wholly om one side unless promptly snuffed. j  Here the connectioh between the tallow eandle and the talking are light |/becomés apparent, for when the candle began to Sputter us the wick leaned it was under- stood to be delivering a message to what- ever member of the family the wick pointed at, as is set forth with accuracy by the poet who wrote:  There's a message in the candle  : And it points direct to me. | |  Those who infer that my education has extended to actual) observation) of the Manufacture and| use of tallow) endles will be right. as t infer they usually are. For though IT myself date more especially from the era of the coal oi] lamp, I have always made ita point from my earl: south to cultivate the acquaintance of that conservative element of! society Which deliberates and consideré before adopting changes, proposed in |methods hatlowed by time.| Among the donserva- tive’ I found those who gladly promoted my education in those arts which belong t othe most respectable .and consistent conservatism. So that I have not/only ob- served the. actual manufacture $f tallow candies. but have actually assisted in it by holding the molds and helping to pro- vide! the sticks on. which to stretch ithe wicks. I have also been present and in some sense participating when butternut and other dye stuffs) were being prepared for the manufucture of cloth. | T have never prepared the) corn husks, or per- haps more accurately. ‘shucks,’) for the cores of cotton thread’as it is manufac- tured on a spinning! wheel, but am fa- miliar by actual observation ith that whole process from carding the batting to working the hand-loom. Aithough I have never actually manufactured soap. I have actually poured water into the “‘kve hopper,’”’ as a_ beginning of |the pro-  | céss, and I-have observed the successive stages of the process so closely-that Iam  eonfident of my present ability ta conduct  a:soap factory of the antique spe. with  aitew -suggestions Hgts any old settler  who hail sufficient jconfidence fh me to  permit me to take charge of the work  under his supervision. | a  This is not by any means alll 1 know by actu:tl observation and incomplete ex-  periment cf the liberal and athes arts of the old settlers. Fdr instance, am fa- miliar with the process of making both  ‘split-bottomed and  “shuck-bottomed!’ chairs. I could describe with comparative accuracy the various stages of Se  ‘ture through which a cypress ‘knee’ zoes  ‘before it is.converted into a well bucket, and I nave myself Manufactured a -‘‘dip- per” from a gourd. I might go jon men- tioning a long list of other things belons~ ing to the useful or the literal arts of the past. of which many in the present know so little that they have not been able to suspect the extent either of my infor- mation or their own ignorance|. When I suggest it here, thus ripe beh it is not with a view to bringing myself into greater reputation, but rather of suggest- ing to many who pride themselves on b¢ ing up-to-date, how great ‘is the extent of their ignorance of the useful) and lib- eral arts which belong to an era, without which they and everything they are proudest of knowing would have been im- possiblc. i | ; Thus an Old Settlers’ day at the Fair I am able to re-enforce them not dnly with moral support, but ey with intellectual support made posal le by actual know!l-  ‘edge of the asséentidls of the age of the tallow candle.

In order to begin the review of the pic- tures in the galleries devoted to the col-, lection pt British art, we- prefer to start with one of the smaller rooms. The one we have selected is) number 79, on the ground ‘plan. We do this chiefly because it happens to coritain works of a few thor- oughly representative painters which are so conspicuously representative of the school as a; whole, that a point-of view ean be obtained from which we can more advantageously judge of the remainder of the collection than if we began with the largest room.  In the central position on the line on the south wall of room 70 is a large life- size portrait of Sir David Stéwari,. late provost of the town of Afoenngen in Seot- land, by Mr. William Quilier-Orchardson.  | We have not the slightest hesitation after | frequent visits to this superb masterpiece in portraiture, in saying that it is the | greatest portrait in character, color and | treatment that, in our estimation at least |has been produced-during the last fifty lyears. A similar conviction On the part of those even who have no pretensions to | be judges of art can not, we think, but be also arrived at if they will, without prejudice, make a conscientious study of this remarkable work;  The leading characteristic of all Mr. Or-  chardson's work is the absolute restraint to which, throughout his whole career, he has subjected himself, so that there shall be no undue intrusion of the ability or the acquirements of the artist himself. In other words, his portraits are #s imper- sonal as it is possible for a picture to be. Not only that, but he also eliminates from his representations any accentuation of the position in life, or the honors which have been conferred upon his subject, nor does he care for the exploitation,.of mere habiliments, uniforms, insignia of officé or other ephemeral paraphernalia, which are-so much affected. by the majority of portrait painters. “In the present case the color of the vel- vet robe. magnificent though iit is, is sub- ordinated entirely to ihe search for and ‘the representation of ,the character and endowments, physical and mental. of his subject.

No. 1@1, “Summer Morning,” by Willem Hendrik Mesdag, The Hague. The painter of this beautiful picture is a man of inde- pendent means, a great collector of art objects and practically the doyen of the artists of his native country. This picture must either stand or fall by the manner in which the sun is introduced and its In- fluence on the landscape. It has, however, as we see, been very subtly piaced. It is a ges 4 toward the right of the center, anc at such a height as to suggest an overhead sky, and at the same time, by its elevation above the tallest masts in the foresea, it is made to suggest illimitable distances beyond the horizon. The proper place from which to view it is near the north door. From there a true estimate can be formed of the delightful perspec- tive of the coasters and fishing craft both inshore and in the offing.  The sky is packed with clouds and films of vapor, each of which disseminates either the golden yellow of the sun or its ruddier rays. A faint, purplish summer haze broods over the sea on the horizan. The distance is very delicately indicated by the yawl in mid-distance and the two tiny specks beyond. The slight touch of | | red between them and the tenderly drawn broader line of ruddy yellow (one must £0 | . rear the canvns 10 see these) give, with | ~ great knowledge of effect and skill in ex- ecuting them, an immensity of expanse } . and light. Standing away again to the |° left, the reader will be able to appreciate r not only the extreme ot aged of the sur- face, but the exceedingly beautiful blend und float of the colors of the sunlight and of the sky as well that pervade the fore- sea, He will also notice that their monet- ony is charmingly checked and varied by the interception cf the hulls and snails of the various craft that dot the surface. This admits of the local colors of the ves- sels. tempered as these are by the slight haze and the light and color of the zeniths to be reflected in the water, and at the same time admits of their being blended anto that beautiful pearly bluish purplish eray which gives to the almost ungainly hulls a dreamy light reflecting grace of outline and mass that makes their forms so perfectly harmonious with the restful- ness and eee of the whole scene. The Ficture might have been called “A Sum- mer Calm,”’ for the wide, flat troughs in- eaove indicate tuat there is nothing to sreak the surface stillness but the slight undulations that at last ripple over one another as they near and are retarded by the beach on which the spectator stands Pah 84. “A Quiet Corner in Laren,” by ‘rans A. Langeveld, Laren. This pic- turesque, quiet little town among the sand dunes has become since the death of Mauve, who lived and painted there, aS great a center and one almost as classic in the eyes of young Dutch painters as Barbizon itself, ‘ This Jand- Scape is a rather daring effort for a young painter. The sky is full of piled- up clouds on the left, and to the right and over that part of the picture a splen- did stretch of brooding dark-blue rain clouds. The whole landscape, in fact, ex- cept for this sudden burst of pale watery looking sunlight, is in shadow. The sky is very threatening; boding another rain- storm, The distant trees beyond the houses seem still dark and sodden, The pools of water on the grass in the fore- ground show that the pale white gleam in the sky is indicative only of a reprieve.  The thatched roof against the sky, a dark-gray violet. and the tender pur- Pplish gray of the wall, are true to the day and the lighting, and are very tenderly felt. The grass of the yard, partly lighted by the reflection from the sky, is a very varied and lovely green. The shed roof, the mellow dark, rich red of the roofs behind the trees to the right; the- fine bold drawing and springing of these trees against the dark, brooding sky; the “trash’’ in the corner and the color of the old stumps from which thease trees have originally peen watersprouts, are as if from a very mature reach The man and the wheelbarrow are finely and unobtrusively placed so as to give a human touch to the otherwise too lonely scene. The dark green vine clambering SY the gable on the left, the gray blue of the windows, and the russets and reds warm up this corner and give a habitable feeling to the whole surroundings. The fine tune of the green of the pollard wil- low against the roof on the right and the very artistic way in which the stems of the young saplings in the yard are seen one moment, and almost; lost -the next, shows’ power both of observation and execution that promises weil for the fu- ture of the artist.  No, 133. “Evening,” by Bernard Schre- gel, The ie. re This is an extraordinarily mature landscape, both in color and style, for 2a man of 34 years. The purplish clay- brown soil and the very rich dark grayish green of the grass, both in shadow, show a fastidiously refined eclecticism in color and a certain inborn classical chasteness of approach to nature.seldom seen, if ever, until late in an artist’s career. The gradations of this green, especially to the right, where it gradually emerges from shadow, ure fresh and vivid. The bark of the bare stems—the leaves being higher up and outside the picture—of the saplings on the right are most paintably conceived and are both delicately rounded and lighted, their gradation being well-nign perfect. ‘These and the Corot-like young tree to their left, that so beautifully veils the blue space of sky. accentuate the loveliness of the silver pive-greve of the sky above, and add to the distance and illimitability of the rich marbled yellows of the clouds below. Then look how meaces at f yet firmly, all this beauty is achieved. First there is a prepared ground of delicate blue, and then that is boldly touched and hatched and cross-hatched withovt ever being touched with either the finger or the pallet knife and left to dry. Is not this both simplicity of treat- ment and consummate knowledge in one?  The artist has availed himself of the fact that the prevailing northwest wind off the sea—fur where we are is on the borders of the sand dunes—gives a land- ward trend to all tall, slim, growing trees, to give to the group on the left the grace- ful inclination of their forms; a grace like that of Corot and at the same time the he ats of a Rousseau. The spaces through which the tent of the sky is seen are so beautifully introduced that they seem to have introduced themselves. The rich dark green of the foliage is as mature in color as that of an old Con- stable or Dupre, while the beautifully painted light olive yellow and soft gray- green foliage in front of it are all his own; and what a setting that dark green makes for them.  The silver gray-green of the bark of the stems and the dark ultramarine of the spaces where the bark has disappeared are full, not only of an elevated_tender- ness and charm, but or Loman See with what finesse the point where the reflected vellows strike is. just faintly touched with the brush. How deftly 7 how un- hesitating|y the brush travels over that lovely atmospheric, yet gently ascetic, green-blue-gray of the dune on the horl- zon.

Ice cream has been substantialized for com- mercial. purposes, like lemon or black- berry vie. Time was when a lemon pie Was cut it would spread itself limply. nevertheless invitingly, all over the piate; now, when it is quartered and its sec- tions dissevered, it stands up as precise- ly, as immobile and as enduring as if it were made of rubber. It firmly refuses to ooze. Ice cream has acquired the same quality of: durability. It also oozes no longer. In time, if improvements keej: on, it will attain to the same strength of character as the ham sandwich, and it may be possible to lay masonry in it or build world’s fair palaces, or mold stat- uary out of it. It is only a few steps from the ice-cream sandwich to monu- mental architecture.  It is now your uncommon privilege to go out to the World’s Fair and see an apple tree blooming in late October. It  is not. it is true. a Apple Trees tented canopy of fragrant pink ana In Bloom. white blossoms, such as crowns the month of May and makes it in some ways a month more to be treasured in the mem- ory than nut brown October, but there are blossoms, and they are pink and white. They are on the espeliee trees In the French garden. Through the summer months one or the other of these trees has bloomed, to the great amazement and dumfounding of Fair visitors, and one of them seems always ready to take up'the role of floral entertainer when another ceases How this blooming out of season can be accounted for seems to depend on the time at which the trees were set out. Some of them were placed in the soil at the time they would have bloomed, and, failing then, they have got around to their natural function as soon as they could. There is not many of their natural traits that are left to the espalier trees. They have been trained to extend their branches at right angles and to send out branches in as regular order as the arms ot a trellis. The espalier tree is a per- fect example of the subjection of nature to man. It even blooms at his command. It bears frult where the gardener says it shall, and only so much as he says it shall. An ordinary be tree would not know its own race looking upon an espa- lier tree, and should it see one blooming in October it would no doubt turn its back on it as an alien and a freak.  The “‘putting-off’’ people are coming to the Fair now; and there are lots of them. They have put off visiting the Fair from  time to time, in that  Late Comers too - much - trouble- to-get-started way of  to the Fair. theirs, until all at once they have real-  ized that there won’t be any Fair to come to before long; and so the trains are crowded, the street cars bulging at each end, sightseers standing on each other's feet in’exhibit buildings, and other indi- eations that the number of people who suffer from procrastination in this coun- try is enormous. Punctuality is a rare virtue, and one of the faults that some- times accompanies it is an overpunctual- ity—a sort of ‘‘soonerness,”’ as they might say in Oklahoma. People greatly. given to punctuality often have too much. They arrive at the station two hours before the train starts, and they rie an appointment half an hour before the time set for it. Be- ing usually of a restless and uneasy tem- perament, they get as much trouble out of their virtue of punctuality as the oth- ers get out of their fault of tardiness. The two types are always at outs with each bch because they are always neces- sarily and unavoidably making appoint- ments. But all the punctual people will see the Fair and all of the other kind won't. Inertia almost anproaches being "

The educational feature of the Fair is sometimes inmpressed a little strenu- ously.  A man with a silk hat on ought not to talk out of the corner of his mouth; you won't fully realize how imperative this is until you see him do it.  Festival hall has a ri Paige out of each window like a Klondike pioneer’s habita- tion; but they have all been nicely gal- vanized and are almost ornamental if you are not going to be too fussy.  Unnecessary astonishment was mani- fested at the sight of a woman tying a man’s shoe. Isn't it as hard for a man to tie his own shoe as it is for a woman?  All the fly population that came to in- spect the live stock exhibit has remained and is now interested in the horticultural display.  At the races in Buenos Ayres the exhibi- tion of millinery appears to surpass any- thing in this country, as it is pictured for the information of Americans; and half the men wear silk hats.  General Frost, having reconnoitered and found the preparations for defense of the fiower beds so thorough, has withdrawn his forces for the present.

ST. LOUIS TERMINAL MEETING HELD IN CINCINNATI.  CINCINNATI, OHIO, October 28 At the meeting here to-day of the proprietary interests of the Terminal railroud associa- tion of St. Louis, plans were considered for extensive terminal improvements at St. Louis that will be submitted to inter- ested parties in New York, to which city President Ingalls and others go to-night.

During the afternoon the officials made a minute inspection of the immense new freight warehouse erected this vear by the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern, and it is hinted that a similar ware- house to be used as a freight clearing house is planned for St. Louis. The of- ficials were much pleased with the Balti- more and Ohio Southwestern warehouse and its modern appointments.  _ The necessary financing details of the improvements were partially arranged for. These funds will also be used in part to pay for improvements already com- pleted.

Chicago-St. Louis Time Cut Down. frre. DisPatcn TA THE GLIBE-DrMocRA2 CHICAGO, ILd.., October 28.—The man- agement of the Chicago and Eastern ILli- nois has decided to shorten the running time of the Chicago-St. Louis trains from a half hour to one hour, placing both trains on an elicht-hour schedule. The change will be made on Sunday, and the announcement regarding it comes at the same time with an announcement that the Alton and the Wabash roads are to lengthen the time of their day trains, re- turning to the old eight-hour schedule. The reduction in the time of the Pastern Tllinois trains is due to greatly improved eccondition of track and roadbed on the new portion of the double track, and to a desire to make better connections with Wastern ana Western roads at Chicago. Ry the shortening of the schedule, close connection out of Chicago will be made with the morning trains from the West and Northwest and with the night trains from the Kast.  St. Louis Line Election.

But the man is strong and needs not the sympathy that is called out for the mother who carries a heavy baby about in her arms all day. Both hands being occupied, ghe lets her dress trail in the dust, hor shoulders bow out ungracefully, her hat gets on awry, and she has no heart to straighten it, even if she had a hand for the purpose. Around over the Fair she goes, peering carefully and impartially at everything and reminding one of a gold- fish patiently and aimlessly nosing every inch of its glass-walled prison.  Strange footprints are to be seen in tho Fair dust these dry days, and if any one has 2 fad for collecting such things, now is his chance for taking a unique set of casts.

There is the longer track of the flat-footed African, the mark of the cleated wooden sole of the Ainu, or of the Japanese waiter ioe and ths soft imprint of the Indian moccasin. Sometimes the moccasin mark is small, and beside it is a big*dog track, and then it is made by the BHskimo girl from The Pike. who is out with her leash of arctic sledge haulers.  Around in the gumbo dust of the main pois are to be seen the prints of the flat-  eeled Russian boot and the flapping hheelless slipper of the Syrian camel driver, while surrounding them all is to be seen the mark of the spring heel ot youth, the spool-like heel of the giddy maid and the straight-cut congress gaiter sole of age.  Over in the vellow dust of the woods roads are the footprints of the big crows and the blackbirds and biuejays and, pret- tiest of all, the erratic, frisking track of the fat gray squirrels.  The model express office is the clearing, house for-the money of all nations, an sooner or later a piece of all the different kinds turns up there for exchange, and packages are sent to and received from all parts of the world. The office is ar- ranged as express men would like, but not at all as they get it usually, for they have to put up with the plainest sort of fittings, especially in the smaller towns. The counters and partitions are of quar- tered oak and of bullet-proof thickness, and behind them the clerks can dodge’  “when the office gets held up.  “Over in one corner is a carpeted space. some comfortable chairs, a desk with a elean blotter, and a_center table holding an artificial palm. Presumably the space 4s for the use of the washed public hav- ing express business with the office, while the unwashed stands up around a high little desk outside that is presided over by an artificial rose bush in full bearing. Blooming things give a bright and cheer- ful air to a place and ought to be in every express office in the land.  In another corner is another railed-in, earpeted space with desks and chairs, where apparently the express agent re- celves his friends in the ample leisure he is supposed to find.

The man who received the messages stood shivering with cold in a car sent skyward from the aeronautic concourse at 3:15 o’clock in the presence of one of the most representative gatherings that has ever assembled at the World’s Fair grounds.  The experiment was the first of its kind ever made in America, and, according to the testimony of those interested, the Most successfu! ever tried since the the- ory of wircless telegraphy has been put to practical purposes. From the time the balloon left the aeronautic concourse un- til it landed in a field five miles west of St. Louis a constant succession of tele- staphie ticks flashed encouraging mes- sages to the occupant of the basket, and each message was recorded in the nate- book carried by the ascending operator.  The men who made the flight were Paul Bnabenshue, a younger brother of the operator of the dirigible airship, the ‘‘Cali- fornia Arrow’; A. W. McQueen of Guth- rie, Oklaty an operator for the American  | De Forest wireless télegraph company, and Wili S. Forman of the GLosz-Dem- ocRaAT’s World’s Fair staff. The bag was of the 30-foot cutaway type, containing G000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas, carrying a total weight of approximately 50f  | pounds, inchiding the weight of the three passengers, the ballast and instruments.  Prominent People Present.  The balloon was sent up from the con- course at 3:15 p. m. in the presence of World's Fair officials, aeronaytic authori- ties and hundreds of spectators. It arose rapidly to a height of about S800 feet, drifting in a southeasterly direction, car- ried by a wind of an estimated velocity of between five and eight miles an hour. It attained an altitude of about 1200 feet before it-disappeared from the view of thousands of World’s Fair visitors who Were watching the flight. As soon as it left the ground the wireless telegraph in-  | strempnts-on. Pag De Forest tower- near the Press building began flashing the mes- sages. Although the balloon remained in the clouds hardly an hour and a half, the wireless experiments conducted during that time are conceded to have made an epoch in science.  Messages Begin to Come.  At a height of two miles, lost above the clouds, drifting in a direction which could not be calculated, A. W. McQueen of the De Forest wireless telegraph company. stood in the basket of a frail balloon yesterday afternoon and called off to his companions, Paul Knabenshue and a representative of the GLozsr- DEMOCRAT, the following message, sent to him from the earth:  “W. S. Forman. Balloon: I congratu- late the GLOBE-DEMOCRAT on having a reporter present to see the first wireless message ever received in a balloon. *  (Signed) “L. Z HARRISON,  “Manager De Forest company.”  To the occupants of the drifting balloon, shivering with cold that could he ~de- seribed as almost unbearable, there was little mystery connected with the mes- sage. McQueen called it off as he wroie it, the ticks audible to Knabenshue, who rode in the rigging of the balloon, and to Forman, who stoc@ beside the operator. To verify the aerial telegram McQueen removed the apparatus from his ear and  | passed it tothe other men, who listened intently to the distinct ticks sent through two miles of ether. A-moment later a second message flashed these words from. the De Forest tower: McQueen Congratulated. |  “A. W. McQueen, Ballcon—I congratu- late you on being the first operator tp receive a wireless message in a balloon, and our company is to be congratulated on having the only system that can ac- complish such results.  (Signed) “L. Z. HARRISON,  “Manager.”  Tn the space cf a minute the balloon cut through the clouds and burst into a scens ot indescribable beauty. All sight of the earth was cut off; the men were riding above the clouds, with the sun for com- pany. A swirling wind caught them, turn- ing them rapid'y, and heading them awa; from the city. They drifted westward, and -as they went the’ following telegrams were ticked off:  “To Forman, GLOBE-DEMOCRAT, balloon: "

(Signed) “SUSTIN,  “GLOBE-DEMOCRAT Bureau.” | Strikes Cold Current.  -The lavgh that followed the reading of the telegram was cut short suddenly. A cold current of air caught the bag, con- densing the gas, and the craft shot downh- ward. Through the clouds until the earth was visible she sank, while Knabenshie poured out ballast. The descent was dan- gerously rapid. Pound by pound the bal- last was paid out. , é  At a height of 900 feet Knabenshue fun- neled his hands and shouted to a farmer who was looking upward:  “What time is it?”  “Half past 4,"""" came the answer, dis- tinctly. -A few moments later the Balloon skimmed a tree, struck. a fence and the anchor rope was cast out. It caught se- curely in a rail fence and the’ basket struck the ground. .Knabenshue_ threw open the valve, deflating the bag, and in a moment the three men had sprung from the car and the most spectacular balloon ascensfon yet made from the World’s Fair grounds was at. an end.

The Post-Dispatch has given space to reasonable criticisms | |  of the World’s Fair and its management, especially on points  in which it comes in contact with the people and which con- cern the comforts and conveniences of the public. It has} | emphasized criticisms and ,suggestions looking to the better- ment of conditions under which the public shall enjoy the Ex- | position. We believe these criticisms and suggestions offered | | in the right spirit are valuable to the Exposition management and will be given due consideration.  But the line should be drawn between the spirit of reason- able criticism and suggestion, intended to improve the Ex- position and to promote its success, and the spirit of carping criticism and “knockingt”’ intended to injure it in the eyes of the outside public and impair its success. Unfortunately, | there is evidence of the prevalence of this spirit among @ con- siderable element of St. Louisans. It is unpatriotic, unreason- able, and deserves unqualified condemnation.  The suecess of the Exposition concerns every St. Louisan. It is not a private enterprise, but a public enterprise, in which St. Louis has a tremendous stake. The men who are managing it are not managing it for themselves, but for the city, the sfate and the nation. Their success will be the success of the city, the state, the nation.  St. Louis should co-operate with and help the Exposition] management. They should lay aside the hammer of the}: “knocker,” and should lend a willing hand to the work of! promoting its highest success. Instead of exaggerating ita} defects and spreading broadcast false impressions of the Ex- | position and of the condition of the city, they should seek to |: remedy the errors, tell the truth about its wonderful attrac- tions and give information to inquiring friends which will aid | themr in finding reasonable accommodations, cofiveniences and | eomforts which can be found in the city by all who know where and how to seek them.  ' The St. Louis Expesition is a surpassing triumph and should | reap all the fruits of success. ——__—_—_—_++4—______  A picture of Senator Stone saving Missouri from himself and his frierds might be hung in a conspicuous place in the Mis- | souri building.  : ——_____#o_______—_- ASTRAL STATESMANSHIP  That eminent statesman, Richmond Pearson Hobson, believes  ~ we must have a great navy to prevent the military oppression  * gand ultimate absorption of cina by Russia. That nation, he says, “expects some day to militarize the teeming population of China and employ it for Russia’s own use.”  @ The United States must prevent this by building a more pow- erful navy, which will save the Flowery Kingdom by “the force | of its unused strength.”  ' If the unused strength of a hundred battleships can stay the march of the Czar’s legions in Central Asia, just think what they might accomplish if their strength were used.  “Every consideration, of whatever phase,” says Mr. Hobson, - *ealls for the United States to stand supreme, if civilization is t to go forward and peace be maintained. It is militarism, as | ‘ exemplified by Russia, against industrialism, as shown by the | United States, which are the two great opposing forces.”  So, then, when the militarism represented by a Russian army in Pekin, and industrialism, represented by an unused American fieet of battleships, cruisers and torpedo boats on the high seas, coffront each other—well, then, what’ then? Alice, per- haps, can tell us, She has traveled in Wonderland.  If industrialism can be established by astral statesmanship, we shall have to resort to it. But we need instruction. Before spending $500,000,000 building up an unused navy which shali shatter militarism by metaphysical contact with Cossack cav- alry we want to know how the thing is to be done. Nobody denies the profundity and wisdom of Mr. Hobson's proposals. But we must be shown. |  No visitor should fail to see the great newspaper cascade of the Post-Dispatch. It is a free and instructive exhibition and  . Mustrates human progress as well as anything that ean be viewed at the greatest Exposition. —_—_e+o-—__—_—_ W. J. ROUSE, HE DID IT. ~ —, The man who conceived and first proposed the Louisiana  Purchase Centennial Exhibition has at last disedvered himself. He is Mr. J. W. Rouse, editor of fhe Monroe City Democrat.  It seems that Mr. Rouse was greatly disappointed when Con- gress designated Chicago for the Columbian Exposition, but immediately began the agitation for the celebration in 1903 of the Lousiania Purchase. He advocated this in the Bucklin Herald, being then editor of that paper, and other Missouri papers commented favorably on the proposal. The Missouri Presa Assotiation, in session in Kansas City, Jan. 20 and 21, passed a resolution, drafted by Mr. Rouse, recommending the holding of an exposition in St. Louis, and pledging the mem- bers to agitate the question. Then the metropolitan press woke up, as is #ts habit when pricked by the pens of rural genius, end made a great noise about it. The noise was so loud that it made even D. R. Francis and his hundred friends see it as a good thing, and they went to work. And so it came about that the Ainus are keeping house in the west half ef Forest Park, the Iyorrotes’ press agent. is making the ghost of Ananias blush, and the entire area round about Skinker road contains pretty much ail in the world that is worth seemg.  It is a far ery from W. J. Rouse to the hairy man from  _ Japan and the Patagonian giant, but the connection is estab lished by Mr. Rouse hi nself and—honor to whom honor is due.

NEW YORK, May 14—In spite of the gloomy predictions of steamship agents and others several months ago, travelers are beginning again to cross the Atlantic in large numbers, and the outlook is now for a much better season in ocean travel. Es- pecially true is it that large numbers of foreigners are coming to America now- adays. Indeed, never in the history of steamships have s0 many European tour- ists been arriving in America as at present.  Steamship men agree that the St. Louis Fair is largely responsible for this foreign “invasion.” Travelers themselves say that they have long planned the journey to America, and the Exposition has furnished them with a good excuse, for there is hard- ly one of them who has not contemplated a visit to Niagara Falls, to Washington and to Chicago, while many will go as far west as Sa. Francisco.  Speaking yesterday of the outlook for the summer, Gustav H. Schwab of the North German Lioyd line said: “Our ex-j, | perience is that traffic will be larger than] ’ last year. It is surprising how within the last three months the demand has picked up. and the booking is greater than ever.” Smil Boas of the Hamburg-American line, said: “Everything with us is now filled until the first week in July. The season was slow in opening, but people as a rule go later to Europe now than for- merly. The increase in western travel is due to the St. Louis Fair, and the large bulk of the travelers are coming from Germany.""”  An official of the International Mercan- }, tile Marine Co. said that bookings had been poor up to the middle of this month,  .|but for June they were quite good. ‘There is no doubt but that this is an off year,” said this official. “The St. Louis Fair will  ‘lkeep at home many of that class who have  |just so much vacation money to spend, and political conventions and the election  ‘jwill have their effect on others.”  “While our steamers are not entirely filled, the @emand for cabins is constay on the increase,” said a Cunard official,  ‘land we anticipate a good summer trade.”  - One of the managers of the French line  -|said that his company was doing much  ||} better than was expected a month ago.

He says that Stone called him to St. Louis and convinced him that it would not be expedient to reduce the fees of the office, because it formed a convenient fund upon which to draw for party pur- poses. In short, Stone, who was then in the employment of the excise commissioner, urged that the legislature should main- tain the excessive fees of the office for the benefit of the party; | that is, rob the people and the state treasury to keep the par- FS ty’s purse filled. Stone drew $500 a month from the office, os-| | _ tensibly as an attorney, the character oi whose work may be inferred from Peer’s testimony. * Peers throws new light on Stone’s lobby work and at the same time puts himself outside of the list of eligible candi- dates for any court.

Two color pages, vivid and true to life, constitute tomorrow's addition to the Sun- day Post-Dispatch series of “The World's Fair in Colors.” One pictures perhaps the quaintest and most curious human habi- tations on the Fair grounds. The other illustrates the early stages of one of the greatest and most useful of human.- inven- tions as represented at the Fair.  The story of an astonishing scientific ex- periment at the World's Fair is told and illustrated in tomorrow's Sunday Post- Dispatch. The air is to be robbed to en- rich the earth. A strangely mingled prom- ise and threat of blessing and curse to the human race accompany the experiment. Incidentally, also, there is great peril con- fronting the experimenters.  A novel World's Fair romance consti- tutes another feature. It is a romance in which love and advanced views regarding food go hand in hand, but with love lead- ing the way. Many thousands will be es- pecially interested in this unusual story, and everyone will wish long life and hap- piness to the young husband and wife of whom the story teils  A certain picturésque character of he- roic proportions has emerged from an al- most literal hell into the civilization of the first World's Fair of the twentieth century. His story is one of the strangest true stories possible to the living gener- tion of man. He is destined to be more widely talked about than any other hu- man being at the World's Fair. He has undergone experiences that crazed and killed hundreds of other men in his time.  ‘His story in tomorrow’s Sunday Post-Dis- patch reads like an epic of the old ees = 70a days, with a touch of Dante's Inferno added.  The brilliant achievements of a priest and scientist very’ dear to old Uncle Sam's heart are told and pictured as well. He is a remarkable character now in St. Louis, a student, and yet a man of the most helpful practicality. a clergyman, and yet a savant who uses science as religion's handmaiden for the benefit of the human race. He has done some wonderful things —and the prospect for his future gore that he will do more wonderful things still, all for the good of humanity.  An autobiographical confession by a crim- inal well known in St. Louis, compieted just a day or so before his execution for the murder of the wife whom he met and married in this city, constitutes a notable addition to the literature of crime. It tells ealmly and graphically of the commission of perhaps the most dreadful sin possible to a main. It carries its own lesson of the sure punishment of the criminal and of the futility of evil ways.  In the very heart and brain centers of the American army—the war department at Washington and the United States Military Academy at West Point—an unhappy story involving a retired army officer and a ie stenographer is now arousing the iveliest comment. A final decision as to the case of the officer whose honor is con- cerned is yet to be made.

Expected to Take in the Big Exposi- tion Monday Before Leaving the City.  Although he has been in St. Louis since Thursday night, Rear Admiral Winfield Scott Schley hasn't seen the World's Fair, even from the outside. Furthermore he doesn't intend seeing it until Monday, just before he leaves for Washington.  The reason is not that Admiral Schley has any dislike for World's Fairs, or that he hasn't been a&Sked. He is keenly inter- ested in what he expects to see Monday, but to a score of invitations he has smil- ingly replied, “No, I'm too busy now, wait until I get through.”  The business that has kept the admiral from attending not only the World's Fair but social functions as well, is that of the  Scottish Rite Masons who are holding their annual meeting in 8t. Louis in the Scot- tish Rite Cathedral, Seventeenth and La- cust streets. Friday night Admiral Schley retired thoroughly fatigued.  This is what he had done during the day:  Received the Thirty-second Degree in Masonry.  Assistted in conferring degrees from the Twenty-first to the Thirtieth on 60 candi-  ates.  Assisted in conferring the Thirtieth Degree on @ candidates.  Signed his name to nearly 100 identifi- cation patents for members attending the convocation.

The Dutch had their day at the Fair Saturday, and there were none to say “‘it beats the Dutch.” For in its way the representation of the realm of Queen Wil- helmina, at the Holland pavilion, which was open to visitors during the forenoon, and was formally dedicated in the aft- ternoon with Miss Roosevelt as a visitor,  is unique and without a rival.  A reproduction of an old Dutch build- ing of 1601, the time of Rembrandt, is the Holland pavilion, facing Administration way. It is furnished throughout in the Rembrandt style, and the furnishings are so quaint and interesting that they hold the attention of visitors for a long time.  The dedication wasin the form of an in- formal reception, and lasted from 2 to 5 oclock. G. H. Ten Broek, consul of the Netherlands in St. Louls, and Mrs. Ten Broek and Miss Louise Lampimon, who is in charge of the building, received the guests, assisted by C. Von Kesteren, who owns most of the furnishings, and Y. A. Yeringa.  The most striking thing in the Holland pavilion is a very large Rembrandt paint- ing entitled “The Night Watch,” of the time of 148. It is hung in a room which is partially darkened, and the effect is impressive.  <ttsangijetthaiasnipatinmsanailipaiinil "

Isn't that plain, though?  Now, they have wires strung to the top of this tower, and on the first land, about one hundred feet above the ground, there is an operator who ists at a telegraph in- strument. Kvery time he clicks the instru- ment, the click leaps from the instrument upon these wires, and goes scudding up with 2,000 volts of electricity urging it along.  There is a short break in the wires, and the click leaps icross this, with the elec- tricity whooping things up lively. When the spark clears tiie gap it strikes the end of the wire with such vioience that an agi- tation of the current is caused, and the click or the dash or whatever one of th: Morse characters the operator made with the instrument down below, goes off into space, poof!

Fennell, one/of the ex- pert operators, came to the office last night, strung their wires, and in 15 minutes from the time they started, they called upa Western Unton telegraph boy, who was looking on, and clapped the telephone con- nection from the receiving staff on the lit- tle fellow’s head.  Click-click-click came the first message to the Post-Dispatch and a Western Union boy received it.  Maybe this wasn’t a joke on the Western | 1 Union.

The wireless telegraph service between |! the Post-Dispatch and the Fair entered |’ actual service at noon, when the writers at the Post-Dispatch Fair bureau in the Press | | building filed their stories with the operator ‘ in the De Forest tower. The operator clicked them off on his telegraph instru- |‘ ment, the electricity chased them up the |: wire, made them leap the gap, and sent], them flashing out into space, leaving the wire everywhere, some of them hopping off |! low down, others going out into space from |; the very tip of the wire at the tower. ;  The news stories raced through space and buildings for four miles, impigned them- selves upon the little wire at he top of the |, Post-Dispatch building, and slid down the wire to the wireless telegraph receiving Station on the ground floor, (  In this office sat Mr. Fennell, with a tele-|, phore receiver over his head and clapped | to his ears. He sat beside the only instru- ment put in at the Post-Dispatch oftice— |; the responder. He heard the clicking of the Morse code, and began writing the stories.  The news came at the rates of 30 words a minute, and Mr. Fennell sent them, all written just as the Post-Dispatch writers had filed them at the Fair, up to the ed- itor’s desk.  A crowd gathered upon the sidewalk in front of the Post-Dispatch office and looked up at the wires and he little jackstaff, and then inside at the operator working at the responder.  “What is it?” newcomers asked.  _ “The Post-Dispatch is getting its Fair news by wireless telegraphy.”’  This commanded interest at once. Isn't it interesting, really? Isn't it almost pos- sible to picture the flight of the current, leaping from the tower, flashing over houses out in the West End, crossing Grand ‘avenue and going straight through some of the big buildings there, and continuing its course down into the city, where one af- ter another the big buildings lifted their great heads to obstruct it.

The bushes wore pants.  The first thought of Dr. T. K. Hunt, gov- ernor of the Igorrotes, was that nature had allied herself with the war department, and that a new pants-bearing shrub had sprout- ed over night for the purpose of delicately hinting that the head hunters be clothed and at the same time producing a crop of pants so that there would be no excuse for continued flirtation with the war depart- ment on fhe subject.  But his second guess was nearer the truth. He recognized the pants, not a5 4 new crop which had grown on the shrubs, but as an outfit which he had the day be- fore put upon the protesting Igorrotes.  ‘The Igorrotes had in turn put them on the bushes, which could not make more than a mute protest.  The first bunch of dinkey trousers for the dog-eaters were completed Friday, and Dr Hunt grappled with the serious part of the problem, which was to get the Igorrotes in- to them. They could be led to the tailor to be measured, but it was enother ques- tion whether they could be prevailed upon to wear the tailor’s handiwork.  There was a big palaver. The Igorrotes balked. There was more bad talk than there had been since the Bontocs and the Suyoes felij out over the ganzas. All of the Bontocs mixed the talk and passed it to Antero. and he made it over inio pigeon English and passed it along to Dr. Hunt.  They used ajl the arguments against clothes which their wise men had contrib- uted to the unwritten literature of the tribe and added a lot of new ones which they thought out themselves.  But it was no use. Dr. Hunt told them that the war department had apeken, and _ war department must be obeyed. He  mtioned the dimensions of a few of the p mmo owned by the war department, and meponat what the igorrote village would F ‘a2 Mke after the war department got  rough shooting obcdience into them. ,  They had some experience with United States ordnance when they undertook to exterminate the American army with spears Over at home once, and they were im- Rressed  gee 4 said they would wear the pants, Sut ey wanted it understood that they reserved an objection.

The United States, Mr. Loomis declared, has served on 70 out of 100 boards of ar- bitration called to settle international dis- putes and throughout the length and breadth of civilization the wisdom of American judgment is recognized.  “President Roosevelt.” continued Mr. Loomis, ‘‘cherishes the hope that some day the path may be made clear for the United States entering into a comprehensive plan of a with all the nations of the world.”  There are three questions, Mr. Loomis said, which particularly should engage the attention of the peace parliament 2s bear- ing on its labors, anarchy, immigration and emigration.  _ Unless the individual is improved it was impossible for a nation to settle more than trivial disputes.

Their view is that they are re- sponsible for the girls and that the inducements to stay here which have captivated them are not of a kind to justify con- fidence in the ultimate good fate of the girls. Whether the law shall support their efforts or not, the motives of the Jap- anesé commissioners command respect and their purpose in- vites thé sympathy of right-feeling men and women. If it were a question of political or personal freedom the case would be different, but it is a case of guardianship in rich the Japanese who are trying to send the girls home, regard them as their wards for the time being.  . 9 _- MAKE IT THOROUGH.  Prosecufing. Attorney Johnston of St. Louis County com- plains that little direct testimony has been offered to = port the charges of gambling.  The confession of Wallace O'Reilly opens the way to get testimony. Mr. Johnston admits that he has “heard” of some of the men mentioned by OReilly, as interested in gambling a, and the confession probably affords clews to all the savage and vicious games and swindling practiced west of the Fair grounds.  It appears to be merely a question of energetic and intelli- gent investigation; a grandjury inquiry properly directed with  the aid of a prosecuting attorney bent on doing his duty without fear or favor will yield good resulia.  There has been too much reluctance; teo much emphasis placed upon the difficulty of getting evidence; too much blind ness to conditions flagrantly criminal.  With O’Reilly’s testimony to start with, the grandjury should be able to get on the track of the criminals and find indictments. With energy and a deverminaiion to a to conviction the proseetting atiorney can probably make a thorengh job of it.  Oe eg a eet is ant. a "

The feat was accomplished without awak- | ening a watchman, who was sleeping below within a few feet of the base of the bell, tower.  Upon leaving the building, the young men secretly went to a room in the college, in yhich several young ladies, also according | to custom, had arranged a little banquet for the heroes.  Miss Lane was a leader in this function. At the little banquet she first became ac- quainted with the tall, young student. There| was an invitation to call in the very near future. From that time on, there were frequent meetings on the campus and long walks on the streets. | There came an end to college days and college pranks and college courtships. The | young man engaged in newspaper work in St. Louls, and a year ago went to Madison to assume the control of the Medora Mes- senger, formerly conducted by his father,  C. W. Tietsort.  There had been no wavering of the affec- tion which each had had for the other since that Hallowe'en night, and as soon as Mr. Tietsort was settled in Medora plans were made for the wedding. For months their friends have beén watching and waiting.  They never did find out when it was going to take place. The ceremony was performed quietly Wednesday night and the couple, with as much stealth as there had been on that Hallowe'en night, left the house and boarded a train for the South, where they will spend two weeks, returning to St. Louis for a visit to the World's Fair.

LOUIS BY 0. B. JOYFUL. (rom the Post-Dispatch of Nov. 12, 1929.)  In looking over our files for Novem- ber, 1944, we find that Theodore Roosevelt, then President of the United States ard President-elect, had accepted an invitation from the Louisiana Purchase Exposition to attend the great World's Fair then being held under its auspices, and that he had promised to. bring with him and place on Qisplay the celebrated “Big Stick’’ which had made him internationally famous. This stick was the weapon which -Mr. Roosevelt, who whos a very  baweg party, used to flourish in the fac of oth- er nations, kceping them in a state of con- stant apprehension, ard much curiosity was expressed by our people concerning what it looked like; consequently the advent of the President was awaited with considerable interest.  This morning Mayor Kalter Aufschnitt, through his secretary, Finnan Haddle, is- sued an order suppressing the sale of all dime novels bearing such titles as “Fear- less Fred, the Skyey Scudder; or the Fate of the Pirate Airship.""” The mayor believes that such Uterature !s harmful to the minds of our young people and should not be tolerated. He belleves that the perusal of such thrilling tales as these—too often founded on fact—is Ikely to lead young boys to run away from home (there have,  . In fact, been several recent cases of this kind) to follow the life of am airship pirate on the high seas of ether. The order will be rigidly enforced by Chief of Police Raussmitt Heim.  Willie Chaser, a misguided or misin- formed youth from St. Charles, was fined $25 by Judge Sokum Goode this morning for spitting on the sidewalk. This is the first time there has been arrest of this kind in St. Louis for fifteen years.  In the humorous column of the Post-Dis- patch of this date twenty-five years ago today in St. Louls we observe this little verse:  In the days of Edward Butler, Where were politicians subtler? Aw, g’wan!  We have no means of knowing, but we suppose this verse has reference to a cele- brated statesman of that day, who, al- though a white man, was the leader of a great and powerful tribe of Indians known as the Repeaters, and who, it is said, laid in a fine large line of cutlery that year for the purpose of knifing certain candidates who were not to their liking.

The real rush did not set in until after- noon. Many business places which kept open during the morning closed in the afternoon and their freed employes made a rush for the Fair.  The capacity of the street car lines reach- ing the Fair was tested to the fullest. Streams of people were passing through all the gates at all of the entrances.  It is expected that there will be an even greater rush in the evening of those who could not go out during the day. It is believed tHat the night crowd will be greater than on any day of the Fair.  Nearly everybody, it is believed, will stay until the lights have gone out and the Fair has gone into the past. —~— ~~ 2 |  The program of the day opened at 9 O'clock, when President Francis, accom- panied by Mayor Wells and the ceremontes committee of the Fair, left the Francis home at Newstead and Maryland avenues, going to the World's Fair in a privte trol- ley car.

The general suspension of business. in compliance with the proclama- tions ofthe mayor and the governor, en- abled thousands to spend the last day of the World's Fair among its buildings, and they hurried thither early to stay until the lights go out for the last time.  In the crowds were hundreds of children, who secured free admission whether accom- panied by their elders or not. There were other hundreds of poor persons who secured admission tickets provided through the Post-Dispatch.

Half way to the building the procession was stopped long enough for a photograph to be tax<n,  As the column climbed the steps the Sixteenth Infantry Band, stationed under the archway, played “Hall to the Chie,” the crowd cheered and handkerchiefs were waved.  President Francis lifted his hat and bowed and smiled his appreciation.  The party went at once to the office of President Francis, passing through the corridor at the head of the steps, which was decorated with the Nationel and Ex- position colors, a picture of President Francis and the seals of Missouri, Ken- tucky (President Francis’ native scate), and of the Exposition. .

M. Dockery, who arrived at the Southern Hotel yesterday afternoon.  “It is the duty of the city and the State to make visitors comfortable and happy. The genuine, old-fashioned hospitality is the kind that counts,  “First Impressions are always the most lasting, and the early visitors are the ones who will carry the reports back to their homes. Let us receive every- ene with such sincerity that they will return to their relatives and friends with glowing accounts of the Exposition.”  Governor Dockery will participate in the ceremonies to-day. The members of his staff who are already in the city are: Colonel J. J. Russell, Charleston; Colonel Charles L. Wood, Raleigh; Colonel F. L. Lutz, George S. McGrew and T. C. Hennings of St. Louls.  A great crowd will come down from Jefferson City, according to the Gov- ernor’s report. The Statehouse offices will be closed. Governor Dockery says that official business and politics will stand aside now until the Fair is opened and gets a good start. "

Officials of the Transit, Suburban and the Wabash Railroad Company have been working night and day for many weeks over the final problem of adjusting the route and schedule of traffic to meet the enormous demands that are expected in St. Louis for many qponths, beginning to- day.  As a result it Is practically possible for & person in almost ny part of the city to reach any point of the Fair, which is a source of -great convenience when the distances at the Fair are considered.  The Olive street lines will have Fair terminals. The line known as the Mary- land line and bearing a red sign indicating its route, has a loop at the main entrance of the Fair.

The Suburban will also run its line on Union avenue under the tracks of the Wa- bash and into Forest Park, and has ter- minals for its Kirkwood, Brentwood and Clayton line near the Administration building.  The Rockhaven line of the Suburban will also have a convenient arrangement for entrance to the Fair.  The Wabash shuttle-train service was thoroughly tested yesterday and found to be satisfactory. This service will be op- erated between Union Station and the Fair grounds, and the present schedule permits traffic to depart from each of the terminals every fifteen minutes, but, if the traffic demands, this service can be increased to a marked extent. | "

CURRENT PREVENTS CALLS. Boats Dash in Before the Recep- tion Committees Are Ready —Officers Visit Mayor and Fair.  Without warning and while official har- bor boats, private yachts and immense excursion boais were waiting at their wharves for the public reception commit- tees to arrive, the United States gunboat Nashville and the torpedo-boat destroyer Lawrence steamed up the river and an- chored below the Eads bridge at 9:30 o'clock yesterday mozning.  No one expected the strangers until noon, and it was thought that by leaving at 10 o’clock local officials and the public might board their steamers and be far | @cwn the river to grect them. | The two representatives of the navy had been making good time {> spite of the seven-mile current that opposed them, and had come to anchor before any bozt had @ chance to cast looze her cable.  The Nashville, with her two great yellow smokestacks looming sixty feet above the water line, and with Pilot Bob Gaines at the wheel, led the precession up the river until within a half mile of the Eads bridge, when, like a dart from a bow, the grimy, smudgy Lawrence in her war paint of “torpedo-boat green,”’ shot past her ang cast anchors in the soft mud a hundred yards north.  With three-inch cables attached to her anchors the Lawrence could not hold the bottom, however.  “It was not that our anchors would not hold,” said Lieutenant A. M. Proctor, her commander, later, “but the bottom of the river wonld not hold”  While the Jong-pa. -out chains attached to the Nashville's anchor helped to drag them deeper and deeper in the mud, the Lawrence's anchors fouled, and the cables, affording no ballast, she was compelled to dirft away.  Once again she attempted to anchor be- low the Nashville, and again she failed, and, as though indignant at her recep- tion, she broke her leash and darted down the river at a rate that made the oldest pilots stare. Lieutenant Proctor finally pacified his ship sufficiently to induce her to tle up against the Government snag- boat Wright at the foot of Meramec street, where she remains.  GREETINGS BY MEGAPHONE.  | During all this time reception commit- tees representing the city government and gentlemen who had invited private parties on beard their yachts were blowing whistics-in despair and wondering when the formal ceremonies of the day were to begin.  The little launch Outaga, bearing John T. Davis, F. D. Hirschberg and Thomas Mc- Kittrick, finally maraged to make fast next the Nashville and were enabled to in- form Commander Hubbard that Mayor Wells and the city officials would be glad to see him ashore. i  In the meantime the harbor boat Mark Twain, whose name seemed to inspire happy memories among the crowds that thronged the Levee, steamed out with the following officials aboard: Captain Thomas | Cooney, Joseph P. Whyte, Harbor Com- missioner E. A. Hoberg, Assistant Harbor Commissioner; Paul Young, T. E, Green, Charles Witthoefft, Robert Aull, Lather | Tennent, 8 BH. Bdwards, Thomas C. Hen- ning, James P. Newell, J. R. McCarthy, | | Fred Widener, William Flynn dnd B J. | ONeill.  The Twain could only circle about the | ' gunboat and megaphone good wishes, | however, for the swift current and the | | new paint of the Nashville would brook | | nes familiarities. [  Captain Russell Gardner had a delega- | tion of carriagemacers aboard his ho» | ‘ pitable yacht Annie Russell, and they, too, were unable to accomplish anything more | ! than quaff goof cheer to the Nashville, | ' while her orchestra played airs from the | | acerter-deck and the commander called a | ' special session of the carriagemakers to- | | gether in midstream. ‘  By this time the big excursion boats | | Belle of Calhoun, the Corwin B.

I eam charmed with St. Louis and my recep- tion ere and expect to enjoy the Expo- sition’as greatly as I did the Philedalphia Centennial in 1878 and the Paris Exposi- tion In 1878. These were my last efforts in this direction.  Accompanying Commander Hubbard were Lieutenant Commander Horace M. Witzel, Lieutenant Roscoe C. Moody, En- sign James C. Kress, Ensign William 8. Case; Midshipman Roy M. Ryden; Assist- ant Surgeon Herbert O. Shiffert; Assistant Paymaster H. D. Lamar, Pay Clerk lL. E. Conner. On the Lawrence are Lieutenant Andre R. Procter and Lieutenant Roland L Curtin. ‘i  There was no fuss and feathers, no re- ceptions, no visitations on the part of the officers and crew of the little Lawrence. Provoked at her inability to keep the bot- tom of the river from slipping beneath her enchors, she steamed far down be- neath the Workhouse quarries and tied up along the Government snagboat Wright.  TO RECEIVED VISITORS MONDAY.  The Lawrence ts simply a little térror. Two hundred and forty-six feet on the water line, with 23 feet beam and 9 feet draught, she can carry enough coal to cross the Atlantic Ocean, if necessary, at a nineteen-knot clip. There are no glint- ing brass works on her decks. Her guns are as black as her black-green hull. Her two torpedo tubes, with her four white Whitehead torpedoes, could dismantle any ship afioat.  The Nashville to her Is a toy, a play- thing. In warfare she and her commander would be alert for battleships to ensnare by false lights in the night, or torpedo- boats to destroy in the noonday. Her seven six-pounders can shoot with prize precision sixteen shots per minute and make bull’s eyes at 2,000 yards every round,  Her Lieutenant Commander, A. M. Proc- tor, is the son of a sturdy son of the Vermont granite hills, the late United, States Senator Redfield Proctor. Her sec- cond officer, R. I. Curtin, is the grandson of the famous war Governor of Pennsyl- vania, Richard Curtin, the friend of the Camerons and of Lincoin.  By Monday the Lawrence may conde- scend to come up and anchor alongside of @ wharfboat and let the public come and tramp over her, but until then, at least, she fs going to cleave close under the lee of the snagboat, and she cares not whether anyone sees her or not. To-day and Sunday the big excursion boats will leave every hour for two-hour trips around both ships.  It is not expected that efther ship will be ready to receive guests before Monday, but the river itself is an interesting sight for visitors.

Distinguisheé visitors at the World's Fair opening exercises were unanimous in thelr expressions of admiration and predictions of a grand success for the Exposi- tion. A few of the comments were:  Prince Pu Lan: “A glimpse of the rising sun! It typifies all that is grand in this life or the next.” ;  William H. Taft, Secretary of War: “‘The greatness of the Exposition prohibits me doing it justice in a few sentences. Without a more detailed inspection I cannot compare the Louisiana Purchase Exposition with others, but, judging from general  |] appearances, I doubt not that ft will prove to be the paragon of expositions, fulfilling abundantly the promises of this opening day.”  Governor Peabody of Colorado: “We Coloradoans rarely admit that there Is any- thing more beautiful than our mountains, but I, for one, am forced to admit that the World's Fair exceeds in beduty and grandeur our lofty penks clad In snow, our rich valleys and our impressive ranges.”’  Colonel Watson, the Royal British High Commissioner: “I belleve this will go Gown into history as the greatest of world’s expositions. It is beyond the power of words to describe.”’ :  Charles S. Sprague, Secretary of the Senate of the Colorado Legislature: “The World's Fair is a conjure city. It seems impossible to believe that it was conceived and builded by men. It impresses one as something breight into being by magic.”  Governor Dockery: “The opening ceremonies were ..e most inspiring I have ever witnessed. Providence was kind to us in giving us.an ideal day. The success of the Exposition is assured, and I am convinced that it will be the triumph of the century.”  Giovanni Branchi, Commissioner General from Italy: “It seems a pity that such } magnificent structures should not remain always.”  Sir Adalbert- von Stibral, Commissioner General from Avstria: “No Buropean a decade ago would have believed that there could be so magnificent a spectacle as this in your Western country, but we are rapidly becoming educated to the wonderful re- sources of your country and the marvelous genius of your great men.” ¥  Jules Carlier, Commissioner General from Belgium: “I have never seen anything so magnificent es that picture at the opening ceremonies.

The Americans are a great people.” :  Wong Kai Kah, Vice Commissioner from China: “The Prince tells me that he ts greatly pleased, eth with the beauty of the Fair and with his reception.”  Colonel Francisco de Souza Aguiar, Commissioner General from Brazil: “Words are feeble in describing the completed Exposition.

If there be anything fn auguries, surely the people of St. Louis sh~uld feel that fortune will continue to be propitious to the enterprise.””  Theodor Lewald, Commissioner General frem Germany: “Germany has always had faith in the greatness of this Exposition.

The Icorrotes will soon have a shower bath rigged up for them in their village. It may shock you to learn that the bath will be for both men and women, and that it takes the place of the streams fn which they bathe when at home. Centrary to general belief, the Igorrotes are a clean people. .  The Igorrotes will have a big dog feast to-morrow. Governor Hunt has secured the necessary number of dogs, and he will let the head-hunters dance and feast to their heart’s content. It will be one of the biggest feasts they have held since they reached the World's Fair.  “They nave been working hard and I  guess they’ve got a good time coming to them,” said Governor Hunt. + Friday is the Mohammedan Sunday, and therefore there was no work yesterday among the igorrotes and several of the other Mohammedan tribes at the World's Fair. They held their own services and observed the day ds they do all Fridays.  Another bunch of Apaches was received at the Indian exhibit yesterday, and when some more Comanches reach “Indlan Hill"" the exhibit of the primitive people of the United States will be complete. The In- dians have-about finished their respect.ve homes, and the collection of abodes is one of the most interesting features of the Fair.

Capitan looks a little the worse for wear, but he’s a long way from the graveyard.  A 18-year-old Negrito mother, with her child strapped to her back, excited some curiosity yesterday afternoon when she did the family washing. She kneeled down at the pond and proceeded with her work as if she were not kncumbered with the chilé and apparently unconscious that the baby was on her back.  “Now, isn’t that Just a wonder?’ ex- claimed a woman to her companion, and the other woman sald:  “Just!”  IGORROTES DISCUSS THE WEATHER Recall Chilly Spell When Julio’s Wife Eloped With Jualio’s Brother. Chief Antonio and Presidente Domingo of the Bontoc Igorrotes met Presidente Byungasin of the Suioc Igorrotes in front of Governor Hunt's cottage yesterday morning when the wind was whistling through the village and white people were  wearing overcoats.  “This reminds me of the cold ll we had in the fall of 1886,” remarked Chief Antonio, according to the a  “Yes, it does,” assented Presidente Do- mingo. “That was the time when there was ice on the lake.”  “I am reminded of the cold spell when the creek overflowed the north meadow of my village,” said Presidente Byungasin. “1 eat remember the year, but I do the flood.

For the first time since they have — at the Philippine concession this ancient rite was observed yesterday morning by Presidente Byungasin.

But clean the red man up a bit, polish his mind and body, and no longer does his person affront a sense of the decencies.  Then we, whose living is a complicated matter, are compelled to admire, even to envy, the ease with which he disposes of the problem of a home.  Within the Indian School, prominently displayed and nicely printed by some In- dian hand, is this saying: “Indian nature is human nature bound in red.” It is a good saying to have in mind when visiting the Indians. It helps in fixing a fair esti- , mate of the big Pawnee Chief, who has— proved to be taller than the Patagonians, the man reputed the tallest men in the | world; or in understanding the Reverend | Doctor Scott-Charging-Alone, Sioux Epis- copalian minister; or in studying ““Madame Pueblo,” the Pueblo Indian housewife, as she manages her crew of children; or in appreciating Mr. and Mrs. Benson, high types of Indian progress.  No more of human nature fs bound up In any 2-year-old of the land than shines from the aueer, small face of “Baby Pueblo” when his sister underiakes to wash him.  A Pueblo wife sweeps the flocr of her tent clean as a pinhead about twenty times a day; at least, that Is true of the excellent red lady of her tribe who pre- sides over a family of ten near the Indian School. This is not all. Each daughter seems to have as her special task the duty of keeping the child next youngest clean. ‘They spend half their time washing each other.  The youngest ones, too. exhibit all of the earnest ambition to wallow in dirt which charatterizes «a healthy white youngster. The baby, a chubby creature, is all smiles and amiabliity. When the rest are either busy washing or with some other household duty, Baby Pueb- lo sees his opportunity. He toddles out of the tent, falls, and lovingly em- braces the dust heaps. For a time he will sit, picking up as much of dirt as his tiny hands will hold and throwing it in alr as far as his mite of muscle per- mits. By and by. this does not satisfy and down he lies, rolling over and over in the dirt, his absurd grin meanwhile be- speaking the ecstacy of the moment.  Just when Baby is enjoying the full bliss of this dissipation, Elder Sister, who is en- dowed with the wisdom of fcur or five  sumfners, discovers him. Elder Sister locks inexpressibly shocked and Baby gives every indication that he knows exactly what ts coming. Elder Sister swoops down upon the erring child and Baby doubles up his ridiculously little fists, digs them into his eyes and rears In protest.  Elder sister grabs Baby by one arm and jerks him rapidly toward the wash basin, | | where she scoops up the water in handfuls | | and applies it vigorously to face and hands.

The former Queen was piqued Monday afternoon when she reached the Union Station and realized that there was no reception committee to welcome her to St. Louis. She was angry when she had to pay her way Into the World's Fair grounds, and still angrier when she was told at the Inside Inn that ® certs addl- tional for herself and each member of her party would be added to her bill each day, the sald 5 cents being for admissions and for the Exposition Company.  Queen “Lil” did not sulk. That would not be royal. Indeed, she remained closely in her room and gave ft out that she was “sick” and could see no one. She positive- ly refused to see anyone. The Princess Kalanianole, wife of Prince “Cupid,” the fogmer Queen’s adopted son and a delegate in Congress from Hawali, formally called on President Francis and inspected the grounds.  However, the former Queen was not to be deprived of seeing the Fair, for Tues- day morning she summoned a bellboy and told him to call a carriage for her, and gave him $2 to say nothing about it. When the carriage arrived, she, accompanied by the Princess and her secretary and com- panion, got In and took a long drive over the grounds. They were not recognized by anybody, the Queen sitting In a rear seat ef the carriage and well shielded from view.

She thanks you most cordially for calling and for your kind solicitation for her health.”  It is to be presumed that the former Queen enjoyed the snub that she was ad- ministering to the Exposition officials and friends in St. Louis, and that she also enjoyed her tour of the various buildings and of ¢he Pike, Wednesday night and on Thursday Prince “Cupid” was with his mother and his wife on their secret tours of the grounds and the Pike, but frequent- ly he drepped behind them so as not to attract attention, as he is comperatively well known to Exposition officials and others at the Fair.

They are the editors of the American country papers and the makers of the city papers, with a sprin- Kling of journalists from abroad.  The latter look upon the American repre- sentation with the keen interest which would analyze and make notes on us.  Such fs the attitude of Sir Hugh Gil- zean-Reid, the English journalist who will preside at the World's Fair Press Parlia- ment and who has been a foremost figure in organizing the newspaper activities of the world. He studies American conditions and is chiefly surprised at the number of successful dally newspapers published in the cities of the United States, even down to towns of 10,000.  “How do you do it?” he asks. “Js the cost of production less than with us? Or is the seale of wages lower?”  To the latter the answer in general is negative; to the former, you explain the facilities and economies obtained by means of the various news services, and by the extensive syndication that enables many publications to secure jointly much matter that none could afford individu- ally. .  “Yes,” he said, “I suppose that that is it. But the results are marvelous to me. The papers, too, are so good. Wherever one goes here one finds a paper which has the news, well stated and well displayed.  “You spoke of syndication. Syndication @oes not work in England. Along with Mr. Andrew Carnegie I was identified with Joining under one management a number of newspapers in various parts of the Soantry, It was unpopular, and after a time each of those associated bought back Sheir respective properties.”  “Sir Hugh,” you will then say, “the =a syndication leaves each publica-  independent, a unit, and the syndi- ®Sated matter is merely uncolored news of frepenines or consists of literary contri-  “That ts good,” was the reply. “The only criticism, then, which I might ven- fare, t that an extensive practice of the kind might result in a sameness.

A London pa- Per. having an extensive and thorough service, will duplicate its news and dis- Patches to other cities of Britain, say Birmingham, where practically the same paper will be printed. In Birmingham, two, or three, or four pages of local news and advertising will have been gathered. Here is what now seems profit- able co-operation in England.”  Sir Hugh ceased talking for a moment. Then, suddenly, his features lit with en- thusiasm as he said:  “I spoke of the ha’penny papers of England. Only twe things I claim for myself out of my life’s work. i began the movement which has resulted in cheaper newspapers for the English peo- ple, and I have helped toward federating the press of Europe. I hope that both things will aid in perpetuating a higher journalism.  “At Middlesborough I established. some years ago the first ha’penny paper ever printed in the country in England. Later, I took part in establishing other weeklies | and dailics, anc finally became associated | in the management of the London Echo. But this first venture had in it what I es- teem to have been a genuine service to the country people of England.”  In the later eighties Sir Hugh resigned from active newspaper management, He then took for his task the effective or- ganization of newspaper workers. The un- derlying purpose was to unify this power- ful boiy of men, so that their influence might be recognized and their standing as a profession be more definitely estab- shed.  The first fruits was the incorporation in 189 under royal charter of the Institute ef Journalists. So much accomplished, his ambition extended to affiliation with simi- lar organizations in the other European countries. The result was the Interna- tional Press Congress of 18%, at which the besis was laid for a permanent interna- tional association. .  “The International Press Congress,” said Sir Hugh, “has met at intervals in the various capitals of Burope. Some of yor American journalists have been present at different times,.but in no formal way. One thing which I hope may grow out of the World's Fair Press Parliament in St.  | Louis is such a bond between the press of Europe and America.  “It is with great pleasure that I find my- self here to preside at the parliament. Everyone has been so very kind to me. Do you know, it was about half-past 11 at night iast winter when my daughter roused me, saying, “There's such an ex- traordinary telegram come from America.” This was the invitation to preside, from President Francis.”  ‘Sir Hugh still has the telegram. He took it from his wallet, read it over: and, smil- ing, he added:  “T felt very greatly honored, and Y sat right down and cabled, ‘Yes.’ ”  Sir Hugh is the Member of Parliament | for Aston Manor. In this capacity he was an earnest and a foremost advocate of an international penny post. and he seconded the first motion for its adeption by the House of Commons In 1885. He is among the celebrated journalists of Europe. "

True, we have heard it said often that this so-called “Java and Mocha” which we drink comes neither from Java nor from Mocha, but may have originated anywhere, but, to an extent at least, we have discounted such statements, and have assured our guests confidently at the breakfast table that the morning bever- age is indeed the real thing—a genuine dave and Mocha biend.  The last, lingering superstition on the subject goes glimmering after a short Stay tn the Brazil building. Directly over the main entrance are found these sig- mifcant figures on coffee exports, cover- ing the years between July, 191, and July, 1903: Brazil, 16,246,000 bags; other countries 3,342,000 bagma The following amplification of the figures is etill more disturbing:  Bxports from Brazilian ports—Santos, 20,000,000 bags; Rio Janeiro, 5,149,000; Bahia and Victoria, 754,006.  From Colombia and Central America, 114,00) bags  Venesueia, 800,000 bags.  Java, 46,08 bags  Hayti, 426,000 bags.  Other countries, 517,000 bags.  In the face of Java's 43,00 begs-of 132 pounds each, as compared with the total production, how can we continue to be- lieve in the long-boasted Java coffee, even though we may have paid the price de- manded for the brand? And J. C. Alves de Lima, coffee expert and delegate from Brasil to the Exposition, declares posi- tively that we don’t get Java in the United States at any price.  “The Java coffee is practically all used in Holland,” be said, “‘and certainly the amount that gets to New York is only a very few thousand bags. At that I have known Brasil coffee to be shipped to Java and reshipped thence. Rotterdam, by the way, ia one of our largest export ports."" By refsrences to a compilation of coffee export statistics, prepared and translated inte English by order of the Minister of Agriculture and Public Works of Brazil, it is found that 100,753 bags went from Rio and Santos to Rotterdam in 1x2 Antwerp also received 461,580 baga It is curious to note also that Alexandria, Bagypt, in Mocha territory, took 4,05 begs from Brazil. Shipments to New Or- leans and New York amounted to 715,309 and 453,047 bags respectively. The total for the year was distributed among 142 ports in all parts of the worid.  So we ars compeied to recognize the fact that not enough real Java is grown to supply Holland itself, and that at least 98 per cent of the so-called Java and Mo- cha coffees come from Brazil. Much of it is reared there under the name, being originally of imported scei. Often, ac- coming to the Brazil cormee men, large import dealers of the United States will mir with e large bulk of Brazil coffee emall quantities of African or Asiatic brards, seeking individual biends which suit the tastes of the public that taey aim to serve. In that connection an extraor- dinary fact appears; one of the many pe- cullarities of the coffee trade; different localities favor different coffees. You may see one kind of bean in the Brazil building which commands a high price sciely because it is in great demand in Chicago, and nowhere aise has it proved so attractive.  The development of the Santos coffee district of Brazil Las become almost as significant to the trade of the world as "

Not so long ago the Brazi! coffee was the Rio Janeiro product, and known as “Rio.” Now, the output from Santos doubles that of Rio, and is steadily in- creasing, while the latter is decreasing.  “The coffee pot of the world,” or the Brazilian coffee territory, is included within a strip 1,00 miles long and 30 wide. The best of the district is between 21 and 23 degrees south latitude and 3,00 feet above the level of the sea. Under these conditions temperature varies from &% degrees maximum to the freezing point. The climate is the most temperate on the globe.  At the elevation the occasional frosts are not sufficient to blight the trees, but the cold suffices to kill the destructive in- sects that damage coffee crops in the low- er and hotter areas. The land is a dark. rich purple loam, of the superlative fertil- ity necessary to nourish coffee trees, which Would soon wear out a less fecund soil. At that, fertilizing must be done regular- ly to insure safe and good crops.  From a series of enlarged photographs taken in the Santos district the visitor to the Brazil building gains an idea of the Way coffee is grown, and of the external appearance of the coffee belt. Careful re- Productions of the tree at various ages and of scenes on different plantations, in- cluding illustrations of the processes, such as drying, “shelling.”” packing and roast- ing, are in the collection of views. The machinery used is displayed in the liter- al, and will soon be in operation. The bean will be separated from its husk, the vari- ous kinds and sizes of beans will be classi- fied and the roasting will be done before the eyes. Likewise—and what is more palatable—coffee will be made and served “a la Brazil.”  The gentlemen from Brazil, while they pooh-pooh the notion that alleged “Mocha and Java™ is such in fact, offer some encouragement. They declare that any good, healthy coffee bean, if properiy roasted and ground, will make excellent drinking coffee, if the cook but knows how to prepare it. This is more or lees of a slap at the average cook, but Mr. De Lima makes the statement without any reservation whatever, evidently be- lHeving that few have mastered the art of making coffee. ho""  “Weil, then,” you ask him, “what are the essentials to good coffee?” }  “First, as I told you, the bean must be a good end healthy one, not necessarily  large. After picking, it must be well dried. It should then be kept air-tight in order to preserve the aroma, for at least two years, though it usually fs sold when a year old. Then it should be roasted until the ofl appears upon the surface, causing it to glisten.  “And, finally, it should be ground fine, the finer the better.  “From this point, of course, it is up to the person who mekes the coffee. What you call the ‘drip’ method should al- ways be followed. The ground coffee should be put in a bag at the top of your pot. Then you take your water—the water should be perfectly clear and pure— and when it is exactly at the boiling point, you pour ft Into the bag and let it drip slowly through.  “Now, the usual trouble is that cooks do not take enough care. The water must not be allowed to boil hard; it must be exactly at the Bubbling point, and it must be pure. Then it should be poured through only once, and the coffee should then be served as soon as posai- bie.” "

These fuses were of the ayaa kind and size used for a@ safe installation.” ‘ LADY LILY SAVES MYSTERIOUS ASIA Elephant in Pike Concession Diacov-  Fire in Her Stall and Trampets.  “Lady Lily,” one of the elephantd be-  longing to the “Mysterious Asia’ conces-  sion on the Pike, saved that concession from being destroyed by fire early yester- day morning.  “Lady Lily” occupies a stall in the con- cession, and just about the time that the fire broke out at the House of Hoo Hoo she discovered fire in her stall. She im- mediately began to stamp on the flames and her trumpeting attracted the attend- ants. An alarm was turned in, and thé rompt arrival of firemen prevented the Somes from deing much damage. "

The Patagonian chieftain brought his lit- tle yellow dog, which is the mascot of the Patagonian party. and treated as one of the family. He also refused to register at the hotel without the pet dog.  Other members of Indian families were accompanied by their pet dogs and birds.  Arrangements were made for the ac- commodation of the pet animals in the basement of the school building, and not until thig was done did the strange guests decide to accept the hospitality of Doctor McCowan for the night.  The heavy rain and wind storm of the afternoon and early evening played havoo with the frail-homes of the savage tribes encamped on the Exposition grounds. The tents and homes constructed of brush and tree Hmbs failed to defy the ravages of the storm. Most of them leaked badly and made it impossible for the people to Occupy them last night with any degree of comfort.  Early in the afternoon the canvas tent of the pygmies began to leak badly during the first hard rainstorm, and the little black peopie from the jungle were forced to abandon their abode and seek protev- tion from the rain in the Indian School building, the nearest place of shelter. ,  The Ainus of Japan, whose brush-cov- ered house {is located at the foot of Indian Hill, suffered considerable inconvenience from the storm by the water rushing down the hill into their homes.  They also abandoned their home early Yesterday afternoon and sought safety and comfort at the Indian School. "

Expositions, Says St. Louis’s Is Most Magnificent.  * Charles Wittmann of Lucerne, Switzer- land, formerly connected with Simmons Bros. of London, England, manufacturers of oceanic telegraph cables, and recently identified with the German Edison Com- puny at Berlin, Germany, is now in St. Louls visiting the Fair and taking a week's rest in a trip he is making around  the world.  Mr. Wittmann retired from business two years ago and has since spent most of his time traveling In various parts of Europe. He sturted on his present trip around the world July 1, leaving Lucerne on that date. He arrived in St. Louis August 12 and has attended the Fair every day since his arrival.  Speaking of the St. Louis Fair as com- pared with others he has seen, Mr. Witt- man says it Is by far the largest and most magnificent the world has ever produced.  “As an exhibition, however,” he contin- ued, “I do not think it surpasses those of Chicago, Buffalo and Paris. Everything is exhibited on a large scale, but the variety of the exhibition is no greater than that of other world’s fairs.”  During his stay here this time and on previous visits Mr. Wittmann has sttdied American industries and enterprises to a considerabie extent and makes many com- arisons between conditions as*they ¢€xist fr this country and in other countries he has visited. He is especially pleased with the street-car systems of the large cities of the United States, and thinks them su- perior to those of any other country he has visited. St. Louis and Schenectady, he says. have the most complete systems he has had an opportunity of investigat- ing.  One thing in American cities, and espe- claily in St. Louis, that surprises foreign- ers, who expect to find the pe fae ad- vancerent in ail institutions, is, according to Mr. Wittmann, the great number of grade railway crossings. He says Ameri- ean cities are decidedly behind the citics of Europe in providing against accidents and deluys at railway und street cross- ings. "

This number will include ten of the Philippine guards, which will reduce the present force of sixty special police to fifty ,and fifteen department chiefs and clerks.  The question which has arisen over con- tracts held by several of the department chiefs, who have been asked to resign, has been referred to the War Department for seltioment, “  When the Philippine Exposition Board | jast week decided on a curtailment of ex- penses, at the instance of Auditor Lawshe of the Philippine Government, who recent-_ !y came to St. Louie, they asked for the | resignation of several department chicfs among the highest salaried employes of the Philipipne exposition. After their res- iznations had been asked for. it was found ihat a few of them held contracts with ine Government for the remaining period “f the Exposition. The form of contracts differed with almost every official, end where they did not bear the signature of the Secretary of War, the question arose «#3 to whether they were Government con- tracts.  {t is sald that the contracts will be oon- tested by the mea holding them.  It is the hope of Auditor Lawshe, with ne considerable retrenchment of expenses made by reducing the pay roll. and with recently increased receipts from the con- | cessions of the exhibit. that the Philip- oe exposition will be able to maintain its nancial independence of, the Government during the balance of the Exposition.

Un- Stinted praise is due the people of the ente rprising metropolis  Missouri should emulate the example of St. Louis, in appreciation of the greatest industrial exposition of the age. The opportunity will soon be afford- ed. The Missouri Commission and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition Company have set apart Tuesday, October il, as Missouri Day.  It will be the last distinctive opportunity for the organized nesemblage of Missourians during the progress of the Exposition.  Missouri Day in attendance should surpass all others. It can be done. Sy tematic effort by the press and the people from the Ozarks to the Iowa line, and from the Mississipp! to the Kansas border, will bring to 5t Louls on that occasion a vast multitude Of Missourians  The metropolitan and country press, I am sure, will lead the way. The chief officers of cities, towns, counties, commercial clubs and other organizations should heartily co-operate, and give one Gay to the glory ef this Commonwealth.  Transportation facilities will be ample. Extremely Satisfactory railroad rates are aiready assured.

He arrived in &t. Louls yesterday, and is a guest at the Washington Hotel.  The Order of the Lion and the Sun, by the conferring of which the World's Fair officials will receive so signal a distinction. is conferred by the Shah upon those of his own subjects who by reason of great ac- compishment in the progress of arts and science, as diplomats or prominent figures in the system of government or by achievements in war, have merited recog- nition at the hands of the ruler. In cer- tain exceptional cases the order has been bestowed upon Ambassadors and special embassies to the Ccurt of Persia from oth- er nations, but it is said that the present instance ig the first recorded that the Shah has sent a personal representative to pre- sent the recognition of merit, and the first time that It has been conferred away from the Imperial residence.

DON’T LIKE THE PARIS PLAN. Executive Commissioners’ Asso- ciation Takes Up Question and Probably Will Protest if Ac- tion Is Unfavorable.  Exhibitors at the World's Fair to whom awards will be made desire that such medals or diplomas as may be given to them should state In plain terms for what the award is made, rather than that the inscription should give the group and ex- hibit numbers only.  Th@ Executive Committee of the Ex- ecutive Commissioners’ Association has taken the matter of the inscriptions into their hands for the benefit of the indi- vidual exhibitors of their respective States and have recommended to the Executive Commissioners’ Association the adoption of a resolution calling for immediate ac- tion. 2  It seems to be a cise of whether Amer- ican or French methods shall prevail in the matter of inscriptions on the medals and diplomas to be awarded by the Louis- jana Purchase Exposition. The exhibitors are against the French innovation, and for the maintenance of the American precedent by the St. Louls World’s Fatlr.  The French “innovyation,”’ as the for- eign method of inscribing the medals is called, consists of designating the award to have been made in a certain group and exhibit number, exactly according to the catalogue of exhibits. The exhibitors claim that this method is quite unsatis- factory for many reasons.  The main reason advanced against the French plan is that it is necessary to preserve the catalogues, and that they must be continually referred to. Cata- logues get lost, and then, they say, it will be difficult to ascertain for what the medals were awarded.  What the prize winners want is for the medals, which may be given them. to contain in plain terms for what they were awarded. |  FAVOR THE CHICAGO METHOD. If the prize was for boots and shoes, the sxhibitor wants the medal to eay so, and 10t merely give a group number, tn which night be some other exhibit of an entire- y different nature. This was the method n vogue at the Columbian Exposition at thicago, and proved to be entirely satis- actory, according to the exhibitors, cre nm contrast to the innovation adopted at he Paris Exposition of 1900.  At the pel ld of the Executive Com- nittee of tha Executive Commissioners’ \ssociation at the New York State build- ng yesterday, a resolution was recom- nended to be referred to a committee of hree by the Executive Commissioners’ issociation asking that the Superior Jury @ requested to advise the exhibitors as o how the medals are to be inscribed, nd if the French innovation is to be lecided upon, that they be allowed to of- er a protest. The resolution in full is as ollows:  “Resolved, That the 2 gee tt of the uperior Jury be respectfully requested to onvey without delay to exhibitors receiv- uF awards as to the procedure which rill be followed in the matter of inscrip- ion upon the diplomas, and, if this, as roposed, is to be a departure from Amer- can precedents. and adoption of the ‘rench innovation of 1900, opportunity be fforded all exhibitors for remonstrance ith reasons therefor.”  It is quite likely that the resolution will | ave favorable action by the association, | | thich meets to-morrow.

House of Hoo-Hoo Works in Interest of St. Louis Forestry Museum.  With the preparation of a cummunica- tion to be sent to every State ana foreign commmission and exhibitors interested in forestry at the World's Fair the first step was taken yesterday afternoon toward the establishmert of a permanent forestry ex- hibit in Sty Louis after the close of the Fair. The attention of the Commission- ers and exhibitors will be called to the ex- stence of the St. Louls Forestry Museum in the distribution of thelr exhibits wnen the Fair ends.  The committee, which met yesterday afternoon, was appointed by the House of Hoo-Hoo for the purpose of preparing a permanent forestry exhibit for St. Louis, regardless of whether the House of Hoo- Hoo will be accepted by the city for that purpose, an@ its duties are separate from that of the committee appointed to dis- pose of that structure.  The committee is composed of Doctor William Treleare, director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, chairman; W. E. Barns, editor of the St. Louls Lumberman; Doc- tor J. L. Van Ornum, professor of civil engineering, Washington University; N. W. McLeod, president of the Negoial Lumber Manufacturers’ Association; Her- man von Schrenk, chief Division of For- est Products, United States Department of Agriculture, and George E,. Watson.  The communication to the Commission- ers and exhibitors, which is signed by the committee, ana George E. Watson, secre- tary, is as follows:  The sinilersigned, a committee appointed by the House of Hoo-Hoo, the Lumbermen’s Club, on the World's Fair, a duly incorporated as- sociation under the laws of the State of Mis- souri, have been charged with securing material Tepresentative of forest products for a per-  manent public forest-product museum, to be located in the city of St. Louls.

First, that the purpose of the  Exposition should receive as flattering fulfillment  as possible. Second, that the knowledge-seeking  ‘majority of the public should acquire full benefit  ‘from the advantages offered. As an educational  enterprise of the highest and most practical .type,  as a philanthropic institution, the Exposition de  ‘serves recognition in attendance; as a disburser of innumerable benefits, it appeals to the personal in- terest of all who are able to see it.  The generous endowment, in connection with the variety and quality of the displays and with the magnitude and charm of the spectacle, urges upon  the public, as closing day draws rapidly near, the  desirability, from an individual standpoint, of at- tending and studying the Exposition. The enter-  ‘prise was created for enlightenment and progress,  ‘and the management has no wish more deep than  that the extraordinary educational advantages  ‘should be realized by the people.  - After closing day the value and importance of this iuternational university will grow steadily. Praise of and reference to the Exposition and its influence will be a custom for many years. The Exposition is so excellent in nearly all respects that it will shine as ene of the best achievements of the century. These indications should impress upon those who have not yet seen the Exposition, or who have seen it only a few times, why they should at- tend often before the close.  The loss through failure to attend and siudy the Exposition is pressing upon those who are neg- lectful or indifferent. Such an exposition cannot be constructed again in many years,: as, even if funds and talent should be available, circumstances would be unpropitious; besides, it is very question- able whether an international exposition, embracing the entire scope of exhibition, ever will be held again, as the tendency now is toward special exposi- tions. To all who may profit from the greatest Ex- position there is a particular appeal in the approach of closing day.  —-—_—__ - ----@-e-- —_ __- — CREDITABLE TO EVERY CITIZEN.  Few cities can declare in truth, as St. Louis caa, that reform has rectified simultaneously all depart- ments of the local government. It is decidedly ex- ceptional that the application of the best practical standards in the operative part of the municipal cor- poration is contemporaneous with the exposure of corruption and the prosecution and punishment of publie criminals, Nearly every large city is striving at reform and is getting specific results; but no other city, as far as is known, manifests the capacity of St. Louis in instituting a complete revolution.  The work of Circuit Attorney Folk shows extraor- dinary results, especially in correcting popular ideas regarding integrity in public office and consequently in better fitting citizens for deciding as to nomi- nees and questions of policy. His exposures of crime lay bare the causes of misgovernment and crime; they acquaint the public with the schemes and tactics of malefactors; they emphasize the deg- radation into which such crime lowers the communi- ty; they show the detrimental effect which misgov- ernment and dishonesty have on the business of taxpayers; they accentuate crime’s disgrace upon the city; they set a value on good government and they foster appreciation of respect for the law and for the oath of office.  As Mr. Folk impartially and fearlessly has con- tended against crime and criminals, the courts have maintained their dignity in a manner commanding satisfaction among citizens, the Police Department has given better protection, and the Wells adminis- tration has been establishing system in all branches of the government, carrying on permanent improve- ments and making standards for the preservation of efficient management. There is not one important department which is not better in all respects.  Mayor Wells has impressed upon city employes that municipal affairs have to be conducted in ac- cordance with business rules; and, therefore, stand- ards exist in all departments. He has impressed the sentiment of the New St. Louis. Citizens see the city's finances collected and invested rightly. They are pleased with clear water, with additions and al- terations to public buildings, with street and sewer improvements, with embellishments in the ‘parks, with improvements in the Fire Department, and with other public work. The results of good gov- ernment are perceptible. !  These changes have been going on steadily for nearly four years. Under the direction of Circui( Attorney Folk and Mayor Wells all officials and. em- ployes have performed their duties with a sincere feeling that reform and good government are the means whereby St. Louis is to take rank among the municipalities of the world as a model municipality, whereby disgrace is to be wiped out and the city get the esteem which it deserves to have.  This general betterment is not only an advertise- ment and a great benefit for the whole city, but it is also creditable to every citizen, regardless of his party affiliations. The “Thieves’ Oath” and the mu- nicipal moonlight are not forgotten, either here or at large; but, instead of being humiliated with de rogatory satire from strangers, citizens are now gratified with praiseworthy remarks from visitors upon the work of Circuit Attorney Folk and Mayor Wells, upon the results of thorough reform. Every citizen perceiyes the remarkable change, and is highly pleased. And if he is more loyal to himself and his city than to other persons or organiza- tions, he considers it to be his duty to vote for nomi- nees who will stand by and enlarge reform.  ——_+-9-—___—_- THE LAST MONTH. |  November is the last month of the World’s Fair. It is hard to believe that the magnificent spectacle which has interested and entertained 16,000,000 vis- itors, in which influential world’s congresses have been held, which has made a deep impression on thinkers and inspired the people, is to pass away in thirty days. To all of us it should be a spur to think that the educational opportunities are to be offered for only twenty-six days. The arrival of November brings home thé certainty of the end, and naturally makes all feel more heartily the great value and charm of the Exposition.  There is much satisfaction in the confidence that the enterprise has fulfilled its exalted mission. The people are more enlightened, more liberal-minded, more energetic, more hopeful and better satisfied. The progress of the world has been on display for six months, and there is no question that it has had a potent influence upon the representatives of for- eign Governments and upon men of learning and affairs, as well as upon the people of this country. The Exposition was projected along educational lines, and that the intention has been realized is acknowledged by all visitors, particularly by visitors of experience and knowledge.  -The Exposition makes its appeal for twenty-six days in November—it is-a pity that Sunday cannot  ‘be counted—to all persons who seek instruction, who  wish to acquire a true general knowledge of the  ‘people of all countries and of the state of civilization in all parts of the earth. It is expected that at least  4,000,000 visitors will enjoy the exceptional advan-  tages in the last month; but it is hoped that the at-  ‘tendance will be much targer than the estimate.  _ As the Exposition is not conducted for financial "

The desire for a large attendance in the last month is not prompted merely by commercial motives, but by an unselfish wish that the benefits should accrue to as many of the people as possible.  If there is anybody in the territory adjacent to St. Louis who has not seen the World’s Fair, he 18 advised to come. He should consider that the Jead- ing countries of the world have here the best and largest displays which they ever have made at any exposition; that all races of the world are repre- sented; that the United States Government has an inspiring exhibit; that the States haye remarkable displays and beautiful special buildings; that in the exhibit palaces progress throughout the world Is demonstrated {n an understandable way; that art, science, commerce and agriculture are exhibited in 4 manner most instructive; that the buildings and grounds form a spectacle of indescribable beauty, and that the whole scene is an inspiration.  These instructive displays will become memories after another month. Now they are assembled, that the people may realize greater benefits than ordi- narily are attainable by men of wealth; and while they remain together, for these few weeks, it is earnestly hoped that millions will study them and get the educational advantages. The closing of the World’s Fair on the last night in November is a sure prospect, which should set the residents of this part of the United States to meditating upon how often they can visit the Exposition and how much they may gain in education.  —_——__———++-$-e-—__——-  The president of a St. Louis philanthropic organ- ization avers that women mix style with charity.

Keep up your energy; walk as if you were somebody, and were going to do something worth while in the world, so that even a stranger will note your bearing and mark your superiority. If you have fallen into a habit of walking in a listless, indolent way, turn right about face at once and make a change. You don't want to shuffle along like the failures we often see sitting around on park benches, or lolling about the streets, with their hands in their pockets, or haunting intelligence offices, and won- dering why fate has been so*hard with them. You don't want to give people the impression that you are dis- couraged, or that you are already falling to the rear. Straighten up, then! Stand erect! Be a man! You are a child of the Infinite King. You have royal blood in your veins. Emphasize it by your bearing. A man who is conscious of his kinship with God, and of his power, and who believes thoroughly in himself, walks with a firm, vigorous step, with his head erect, his chin in, his shoul- ders thrown back and down, and his chest weil projected in order to give a large lung capacity; he is the man who does things.  You cannot aspire or aceemplish great or noble things so long as you assume the attitude and bearing of a coward or weakling. -If yéu, would be noble and do noble things, you must look. up. “You were made to look up- ward and to walk upright, not to look down or to sham- ble along in a semfhorizontal position. Put character, dignity, nobility into your walk.  The Japanese Exhibit. Walter Wellman in Success.  There can be no question that the most spectacu- lar and most significant exhibit at St. Louis is that of Japan. It is the handiwork of a new nation, a marvelous one at that, which the people here have spread before them. At Chicago the Japanese ap- peared as interesting and picturesque makers of toys and knicknacks and articles of virtu of characteristic form but limited range—a_ sort of half-developed, pe- culiar people, with a hazy past not far removed from actual savagery and with an uncertain future. At St. Louis they appear as one of the first nations of the world. The greatest world-event of the past ten years is the rise of Japan, and the Japanese have taken good care that their attainment-of manhood's estate shall be duly and fully celebrated in this Exposition cosmos. To best realize what Japan is to-day; one need not go to Port Arthur nor to the plains of Manchuria. It may be taken for granted that the little brown people have startled the world with their military prowess, with their unprecedented combination in one national character of the most thorough preparation and pre- vision, the highest type of strategy, the most fanatical bravery, and the most abundant caution—the bravery which assaults desperately with torpedo boats and charges savagely with battalions, and the caution which never risks a battleship near the big guns of a foe. Finer than Japan in war is Japan in peace.  On Going to St. Louis. f Collier's.  Only about a month remains in which to see the Bx- position at St. Louis. It is one that cannot be missed without loss. No one can see it, or part of it, without learning much that is worth knowing. To become fa- miliar with an exhibition of this kind has much of the broadening and exhilarating effect of travel. It shows us unfamiliar beauties and fills our minds with novel and stimulating ideas. A ride about the grounds, in a gon- dola at night, gives to many a mind as much as would a ride in Venice. It is an opportunity that may not occur soon again, for the financial difficulties of this ad- venture have been such that it is likely to be a long time before there is another. Yet, whether or not it “pays” in the direct money sense, it pays well in a higher sense, as anything pays which, costing a few mil- lion dollars, brings light to hundreds of thousands. To those who have traveled much, a few days in St. Louis mean a great deal. To those whose possibilities of travel are restricted it ought to mean even more; although the Spanish proverb says that he who would bring home the wealth of the Indies must carry the wealth of the Indies with him.  Emerson on Walking. Atlantic Monthly.  Few men know how to take a walk. The quaiifications of a professor are endurance, plain clothes, old shoes, an eye for nature, good humor, vast curiosity, good speech, good silence, and nothing too much. If a man tells me that he has an intense love of nature, I know, of course, that he has none. Good observers have the manners of trees and animals, their patient good sense, and if they add words, 'tis cniy when words are better than silence. But a loud singer, or a story-teller, or a vain talker profanes the river and the forest, and is nothing like sc good company as a dog.  Seamless.
