of the mississippi river to the mouth and cuts it into finished papers each one of which is as hear a universal exposition of the world of a day as experienced feeders of the press can make it  i have seen the different fee se of feeding this press by telegraph instruments lead pencils and typewriters as it is fed at present and i know a number of those who have fed it for so many years that from being at first elate with the honor the responsibility and the power of the work they have savelapes into the semblance of modest shy so tapoken men with here and there among them as mild a mannered man as ever watched his fellowmen engaged in cutting throats and scuttling ships that he might bethe first to get it on the wires that his press might be the first press of the world to be fed with it through special cablegrams   i  these modest shy softspoken men move among the rest of us ata worlds fair with their capacity for understanding and admiring fully developed admiration is their business and they learn their business only as they learn it   at first they reay have agenired themselves  as journalists aboveail the works of nature and of art and there may be among them  here and there those in whom this capacity for admiration is still selfcentered so  that as they look downward upon all that is best in the world they see ee mistakes which might have been avoided in it had their views of itentered fully into it from its beginnings but these too may so develop tin oo their postgraduate course as feeders of the press that hereafter any one of them may be ableto listen with modest and respectful interest to a celebrated prime minister in those countites where celebrated prime isters are  educated to make the worse pear the better part as it is fed to the press and when they have listened learned admired and understood all he has to say of his high statesmanshipthey may be able to ask the one modest pet case full of respect or him his high attainments and his exalted place which whether he answers or declines to answer will wrest out the heart of his  mysterythat few inconspicuous sentences at the close may give the world the better part along with the

last it may make up its own mind what it ought to think of itself teathers the new century may do this perhaps it may do much worse  it may bethat the world as it is to be can only be revealed te itself  by higher types of men than those of the present but when they are summed togéther in their knowledge those who are now in st louis know it as it is in all its continents and in most of its islands it has teen their business to find facts and to state them in ahe time of defoe the first great modern journalist this cast the pillory   though it does not usually cost anything of that kind now it still costs so much that the men who feed the press and learn all that must be learned to do the work give as their tuition fee each one the bestand costliest thing he has which is his life as long as it lasts on earth he does not usually become a saint and never in any case a martyr if it can possibly be avoided but when he has made his last statement of facts and his work is over he has left the world with a possibility of less martyrdom for allthe saints it can produce out of its   own knowledge of its need for them     to the feeder of the press whe comes 1000 or 4000 miles to st

everywhere in their classes but he spends the restof his life in learning that they are also very different in and out of their classes during the rest of his life he becomes more and more interested in them the man tis has seer most of all there is to see of all any great newspaper tells in the course of a year of what the world means is the man at the worlds fair who is most jinterested in everything it has brought   together whether its great or small sore omt or inconspicuous he may have wholly lost  his gg ange ed for astonishment but in place of it he has developed an increasing faculty of interest in and admiration for things that are interesting to si whether they seem admirable to others or not and admirable to him even when others may   think nothing admirable unless it is also astonishing      among these feeders of the press are those who have entered the senior class in the great university of journalism theirs is a fpticenge of speech art pass here and there on what seems   be their owh way but it is the wey thy world is going and what they retain what sticks to them at last without their conscious effort is not merely what the world is saying but what it is

ree lames xt i  the old settlers andtheir view  the old settlers had their day yesterday and yésterday was also the day of the talking are light which shows a number of surprising differences from tlhe tallow candle of the old settlers era taking it for granted that the old settler is more than to years old he dates from the era of the tallow candle for it   was not until after e865 that the coal oil lamp came into general use betore that time coal oil was sold in bottles asa remedy for rheumatism the era of the tallow candle was followed by that of the  spermaceti candle which was not spermaceti at all but a byproduct of lard such as may still be had at the corner groceries so civilization passed into the era of the coal oii lamp and then inte that of the electric light which on old settlers day at the fair suddenly begins to give concerts or to deliver lectures when the button ispushed to turh on the current for the light        in the view of certain old settld4rs there may be sueh a thing as a eivilization too eomplex for those who ure not prepared for it in the sew of some others there is such a thing as an excess of simplicity this is my own view supported by a distinct recollection of a set of moldsfor the home manufacture of tallow  candles they represented the most advanced thought of their era for they molded haif a dozen candles at a single pouring after all the seraps of tallow not available for other purposes had heen saved in some convenient vessel whose odprs were not usually pleasant they were reenforced with cake tallow and after the whole had been heated until it was liquid it was poured through a strainer into the molds where the wicks afterhavying been manufactured previously by the old settlers wife were stretched on sticks so that they extended through the molds to the bottem which conversely speaking was the top of the candles   as a result of this process such of the candles as did not have air bubbles in them came out ready for use in connection with a pair of brass or iron  snuffers placed in the bottom of the candlestick for use about once every five wothutes as the wick burned and leaned overso as to geflect the blaze and cause the candle to gurn wholly om one side unless promptly snuffed j  here the connectioh between the tallow eandle and the talking are light  becomés apparent for when the candle began to sputter us the wick leaned it was understood to be delivering a message to whatever member of the family the wick pointed at as is set forth with accuracy by the poet who wrote  theres a message in the candle   and it points direct to me      those who infer that my education has extended to actual observation of the manufacture and  use of tallow endles will be right as t infer they usually are for though it myself date more especially from the era of the coal oi lamp i have always made ita point from my earl south to cultivate the acquaintance of that conservative element of society which deliberates and consideré before adopting changes proposed in  methods hatlowed by time  among the donservative i found those who gladly promoted my education in those arts which belong t othe most respectable and consistent conservatism so that i have notonly observed the actual manufacture  f tallow candies but have actually assisted in it by holding the molds and helping to provide the sticks on which to stretch ithe wicks i have also been present and in some sense participating when butternut and other dye stuffs were being prepared for the manufucture of cloth   t have never prepared the corn husks or perhaps more accurately shucks for the cores of cotton threadas it is manufactured on a spinning wheel but am familiar by actual observation ith that whole process from carding the batting to working the handloom aithough i have never actually manufactured soap i have actually poured water into the kve hopper as a beginning of  the pro   céss and ihave observed the successive stages of the process so closelythat iam  eonfident of my present ability ta conduct  asoap factory of the antique spe with  aitew suggestions hgts any old settler  who hail sufficient jconfidence fh me to  permit me to take charge of the work  under his supervision   a  this is not by any means alll 1 know by actutl observation and incomplete ex periment cf the liberal and athes arts of the old settlers fdr instance am familiar with the process of making both  splitbottomed and  shuckbottomed chairs i could describe with comparative accuracy the various stages of se  ture through which a cypress knee zoes  before it isconverted into a well bucket and i nave myself manufactured a dipper from a gourd i might go jon mentioning a long list of other things belons ing to the useful or the literal arts of the past of which many in the present know so little that they have not been able to suspect the extent either of my information or their own ignorance  when i suggest it here thus ripe beh it is not with a view to bringing myself into greater reputation but rather of suggesting to many who pride themselves on b  ing uptodate how great is the extent of their ignorance of the useful and liberal arts which belong to an era without which they and everything they are proudest of knowing would have been impossiblc i    thus an old settlers day at the fair i am able to reenforce them not dnly with moral support but ey with intellectual support made posal le by actual knowl edge of the asséentidls of the age of the tallow candle as between the tallow candle and the conversational are mpg hh am not prepared to take the stutid of an extrémist i am satisfied with ve eye less simplicity at present than that of the tallow candle but on the other hand i am not yet

admits of the local colors of the vessels tempered as these are by the slight haze and the light and color of the zeniths to be reflected in the water and at the same time admits of their being blended anto that beautiful pearly bluish purplish eray which gives to the almost ungainly hulls a dreamy light reflecting grace of outline and mass that makes their forms so perfectly harmonious with

brooding darkblue rain clouds the whole landscape in fact except for this sudden burst of pale watery looking sunlight is in shadow the sky is very threatening boding another rainstorm the distant trees beyond the houses seem still dark and sodden the pools of water on the grass in the foreground show that the pale white gleam in the sky is indicative only of a reprieve  the thatched roof against the sky a darkgray violet and the tender purpplish gray of the wall are true to the day and the lighting and are very tenderly felt the grass of the yard partly lighted by the reflection from the sky is a very varied and lovely green the shed roof the mellow dark rich red of the roofs behind the trees to the right thefine bold drawing and springing of these trees against the dark brooding sky the trash in the corner and the color of the old stumps from which thease trees have originally peen watersprouts are as if from a very mature reach the man and the wheelbarrow are finely and unobtrusively placed so as to give a human touch to the otherwise too lonely scene the dark green vine clambering sy the gable on the left the gray blue of the windows and the russets and reds warm up this corner and give a habitable feeling to the whole surroundings the fine tune of the green of the pollard willow against the roof on the right and the very artistic way in which the stems of the

schregel the ie re this is an extraordinarily mature landscape both in color and style for 2a man of 34 years the purplish claybrown soil and the very rich dark grayish green of the grass both in shadow show a fastidiously refined eclecticism in color and a certain inborn classical chasteness of approach to natureseldom seen if ever until late in an artists career the gradations of this green especially to the right where it gradually emerges from shadow ure fresh and vivid the bark of the bare stemsthe leaves being higher up and outside the pictureof the saplings on the right are most

this beauty is achieved first there is a prepared ground of delicate blue and then that is boldly touched and hatched and crosshatched withovt ever being touched with either the finger or the pallet knife and left to dry is not this both simplicity of treatment and consummate knowledge in one  the artist has availed himself of the fact that the prevailing northwest wind off the seafur where we are is on the borders of the sand dunesgives a landward trend to all tall slim growing trees to give to the group on the left the graceful inclination of their forms a grace like that of corot and at the same time the he ats of a rousseau the spaces through which the tent of the sky is seen are so beautifully introduced that they seem to have introduced themselves the rich dark green of the foliage is as mature in color as that of an old constable or dupre while the beautifully painted light olive yellow and soft graygreen foliage in front of it are all his own and what a setting that dark green makes for them  the silver graygreen of the bark of the stems and the dark ultramarine of the spaces where the bark has disappeared are full not only of an elevatedtenderness and charm but

of the public it has   emphasized criticisms and suggestions looking to the betterment of conditions under which the public shall enjoy the ex  position we believe these criticisms and suggestions offered     in the right spirit are valuable to the exposition management and will be given due consideration  but the line should be drawn between the spirit of reasonable criticism and suggestion intended to improve the exposition and to promote its success and the spirit of carping criticism and knockingt intended to injure it in the eyes of the outside public and impair its success unfortunately   there is evidence of the prevalence of this spirit among  considerable element of st louisans it is unpatriotic unreasonable and deserves unqualified condemnation  the suecess of the

for the city the sfate and the nation their success will be the success of the city the state the nation  st louis should cooperate with and help the exposition management they should lay aside the hammer of the knocker and should lend a willing hand to the work of promoting its highest success instead of exaggerating ita defects and spreading broadcast false impressions of the ex  position and of the condition of the city they should seek to   remedy the errors tell the truth about its wonderful attractions and give information to inquiring friends which will aid   themr in finding

militarize the teeming population of china and employ it for russias own use   the united states must prevent this by building a more powerful navy which will save the flowery kingdom by the force

every consideration of whatever phase says mr hobson ealls for the united states to stand supreme if civilization is t to go forward and peace be maintained it is militarism as    exemplified by russia against industrialism as shown by the   united states which are the two great opposing forces  so then when the militarism represented by a russian army in pekin and industrialism represented

bernays holds hermis  safe as the latter has never shown that the is a 10pound better horse than the    picket bernays was quite as good a   13yearold as the picket at even weights   hermis certainly

and the prosecution and punishment of publie criminals nearly every large city is striving at reform and is getting specific results but no other city as far as is known manifests the capacity of st louis in instituting a complete revolution  the work of circuit attorney folk shows extraordinary results especially in correcting popular ideas regarding integrity in public office and consequently in better fitting citizens for deciding as to nominees and questions of policy his exposures of crime lay bare the causes of misgovernment and crime they acquaint the public with the schemes and tactics of malefactors they emphasize the degradation into which such crime lowers the community they show the detrimental effect which misgovernment and dishonesty have on the business of taxpayers they accentuate crimes disgrace upon the city they set a value on good government and they foster appreciation of respect for the law and for the oath of office  as mr folk impartially and fearlessly

administration has been establishing system in all branches of the government carrying on permanent improvements and making standards for the preservation of efficient management there is not one important department which is not better in all respects  mayor wells has impressed upon city employes that municipal affairs have to be conducted in accordance with business rules and therefore standards exist in all departments he has impressed the sentiment of the new st louis citizens see the citys finances collected and invested rightly they are pleased with clear water with additions

duties with a sincere feeling that reform and good government are the means whereby st louis is to take rank among the municipalities of the world as a model municipality whereby disgrace is to be wiped out and the city get the esteem which it deserves to have  this general betterment is not only an advertisement and a great benefit for the whole city but it is also creditable to every citizen

citizens are now gratified with praiseworthy remarks from visitors upon the work of circuit attorney folk and mayor wells upon the results of thorough reform every citizen perceiyes the remarkable
