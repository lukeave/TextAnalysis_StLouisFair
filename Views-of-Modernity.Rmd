<h3> 1.  Introduction </h3>

On the first day of December 1904, the last day of a carefully planned urban utopia brought together people from many different places and backgrounds to experience the world's fair for the last time.[^1] At least two-hundred-thousand people gathered on the grounds of the Louisiana Purchase Exhibition sharing mixed feelings of sadness, wonder, and nostalgia. Some visitors traveled a couple blocks to see the fair and its president David R. Francis for the last time. Others would soon be leaving the United States after seven months of transiting between cultural universes by walking. It was the so-called Francis Day: the grand spectacle of colors, shapes, tastes, and sounds was about to vanish from the city as if it never happened. </p>

<p>   For the last time, fair officials marched from the administration entrance through Skinker Road. After stopping at the Administration building, Francis and other commissioners continued the march towards the Louisiana Monument at the core of the fairgrounds. Behind the monument, separated by the Great Basin, two of the main exhibit buildings, surrounded by thoughtfully designed water ways, contributed to a generalized sense of order.[^2] Francis, Governor Dockery, and other members of the local political elite stood in front of the north side of the monument and addressed the crowd with their closing speeches. Governor Dockery said that the fair's lesson was made evident to every visiting foreigner: that the United States was "the greatest nation in all the world." He also made sure to address the foreign commissioners gathered around the monument to warn them about an ongoing "war of peaceful conquest." Said war, he argued, would prove to every nation in the world the United States' economic and commercial supremacy.[^3] </p>

<p>   Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, world’s fairs became the stages of planned urban utopia in which political and cultural groups negotiated their economic power, symbolic prestige, and modern collective identities.[^4] It is unlikely that the crowd heard what governor Dockery said in a world where microphones and amplifiers did not exist.[^5] If fairgoers did not hear it, however, the symbolic arrangement of the space echoed the governor’s words, and Francis and other American commissioners listened proudly while foreign elite representatives applauded. The fair in St Louis showcased a spatial narrative strongly dependent on the participation of foreign nations and other cultural groups to represent the “uneducated” and “uncivilized.” This article seeks to investigate how local newspapers perceived, experienced, and produced textual representations of a spatially oriented notion of modernity, based on a strong sense of otherness, that underpinned the arrangement of the fair.</p>

<p>   Historians have often discussed how exclusionary principles of modernity, civilization, and progress underpinned the arrangement of world’s fairs. Robert Rydell’s work was pioneer in offering a social and cultural perspective on world’s fairs as symbolic universes that not only legitimized the hosting country’s political and scientific authority in the race for modernity, but also provided “a meaning for social experience, placing ‘all collective events in a cohesive unit that includes past, present, and future. (…)’”[^6] Those principles enabled fair visitors to experience a digestible version of the modernizing world of the turn of the century, one that necessarily required the objectification and visual separation of cultures in space. But the extent to which audiences received the message is yet to be addressed. As one particular kind of audience, cultural commentators like newspapers and magazines responded to visual presentations of modernity and to visitors’ spatial experience of the fairgrounds. In St Louis, during the months of the fair, local newspapers generated discursive representations of the participant geopolitical entities that reinforced an “imagined geography” of modernity centered around the United States.[^7]</p>

<p>   More recent scholarship on the fairs has pushed for a closer attention to how visitors and broader audiences experienced the fair and its ideological message. In 2009, historian James Gilbert wrote about the memory and experience of the fair in St Louis and suggested that scholars of world’s fairs have often described them from the perspective of the organizers and failed to consider common people’s experiences. Gilbert argued that fairgoers did not necessarily look at the fairs as symbolic universes of political and cultural legitimation and affirmation of national values.[^8] To understand the extent to which particular social groups successfully perceived underpinning narratives of modernity and otherness proved to be a complicated research task that is yet to be fully addressed. In response to dialectical interactions between discursive communities who negotiated their modern identities at the fair–in this case, fair makers, geopolitical entities, cultural groups, and visitors–, newspapers had the power to perceive, imagine, and produce representations of the world and said communities.</p>

<p>   Some scholars have emphasized that the fairs were meant to win the hearts and minds “as well as the disciplining and training of bodies.”[^9] As organized spaces of cultural encounters and power relations, the expositions incentivized negotiation in the narrative dimension over each participant group’s view and experience of modernity. Anthropologist Burton Benedict’s investigation of the ritualistic dimension of the fairs stressed the competition between participating nations and intellectual elites during the events.[^10] In a similar direction, historian Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo’s examination of the Mexican representation in the material dimension throughout varied fairs suggested that geopolitical entities, in particular colonized nations, invested in fair exhibits to secure a spot in the stage of modernity. By focusing on how local newspapers, as a particular kind of audience, received the ideological message of the St Louis fair in 1904, this article understands the fair as a complex microcosmos of modernity embedded with ritualistic competition, contradictions, and tense power relations.</p>

<p>   In fact, Governor Dockery was wrong about the war of peaceful conquest. The same evening of Dockery’s closing speech, three dead Igorrote bodies were shipped back from Missouri to the Philippines. The Igorrotes, an ethnic group native of the Cordillera Mountain Range in the northern Philippines, had been objectified and exposed at the fair as examples of uncivilized culture and died of pneumonia shortly after they arrived in St Louis in the spring. Their bodies were kept on the fairgrounds for months before fair officials cared to arrange their shipment back home, which finally happened on the last day of the fair. Along with those dead bodies, other sixty-nine alive Igorrotes headed back to their homeland the evening of Francis Day.[^11] They did not have the chance of congratulating fair makers for proving the United States superiority. The Igorrote’s tragic example encapsulates how the spatial narrative of modernity conveyed in St Louis depended on the otherization of different ethnic groups and geopolitical entities.</p>

<p>   The underpinning message, its perception, and the cultural representations of the fairgrounds and exhibits are equally relevant to the understanding of the dynamics of power between geopolitical and cultural entities. Even though historians have accessed and examined personal letters, diaries, and other sources that shed light on how visitors experienced the exhibits, close reading of these documents often proved insufficient to assess the perception of broader ideologies embedded on the fairgrounds.[^12] In this sense, this article contributes to the field by attending to how cultural commentators perceived and talked about the Louisiana Purchase Exposition through the use of “distant reading” methodologies.</p>

<p>   With a digitally driven argument, this article further contributes to scholarship on world’s fairs as symbolic universes in two ways: first, it demonstrates how methodologies of digital humanities like distant reading, word vector analysis, and named entity recognition can provide historians with new ways to assess the experience of fairgoers and whether visitors perceived the fair’s discourse of modernity. Second, it pushes for a closer attention to the role of newspapers as a particular kind of audience to the fair’s message: one that attends not only to the message, but to the ways in which other audiences perceive and engage with it. By considering and talking about the spatial experiences of visitors, newspapers produced complex discursive representations of participating cultures, and therefore, of the modernizing world.</p>

<h3> "Open, ye gates," and let them "learn the lesson" </h3>

In the morning of the last day of April, immediately before David Francis made official the opening of the world’s fair, Secretary of War William H. Taft, representing President Roosevelt, was trusted with the responsibility to give one final address to the thousands of people attending the ceremony. After saying that the fair was “the union of nations in a progress toward higher material and spiritual existence,” Taft emphasized that “the government of the Philippine Islands has felt justified in expending a very large sum of money to make the people who come here to commemorate the vindication of one great effort of American enterprise and expansion understand the conditions which surround the beginning of another.” The centennial of the Louisiana Purchase, he contended, marked “the beginning of the great Philippine problem”.[^13]</p>

<h3> Extracting Place Names </h3>

Between the first and the last day of the fair, The St Louis Republic, the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch were three of the most important local newspapers reporting about and from the world’s fair. These newspapers were representative of a class of cultural commentators that established narrative hegemony about American culture and politics in the city of St Louis throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century. By the turn of the century, the Post-Dispatch became a “thoroughly national newspaper” with broad interests in issues of national scale.[^14] The Globe-Democrat printed an average of five and one-half columns daily about the world’s fair between June 1901, when the organization of the exposition started, to December 1904, when it closed. Similarly, the Republic and the Post-Dispatch printed the equivalent of 1,012 and 988 pages respectively during the same period.[^15]</p>

<p>   As Cameron Blevins has argued, newspapers were amongst the cheapest and most available sources of geographical information by the turn of the century.[^16]  They contributed to the production and shaping of space in the imaginary of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century Americans by printing particular locations more often than others. During the seven months in which the world’s fair was open to the public in St Louis, those prominent local newspapers engaged, if unintentionally, in determining one imagined geography of modernity. Here, the emphasis on one is important for it reinforces that the cultural and discursive representation of modernity found in St Louis newspapers was only one possible representation in the midst of many others. The analysis of how those three newspapers produced space in response to the spatial narrative of modernity and otherness on the grounds of the fair suggests that the arrangement of the fair and its embedded ideological message reflected much larger issues of the time. It echoed complex decisions in American foreign policy and issues of colonialism and imperialism towards the Philippines.</p>

<p>   The nature of the world’s fair as a microcosmic metaphor of modernity required me to move beyond Blevins’s search for the names of populated places. At the fair, the material culture in display serves as metaphors for the represented geopolitical entities, and every mention of nationality, culture, or ethnicity is intrinsically associated with a geographical place in the globe. For this reason, I made the methodological decision to count not only the actual place names that showed up in the sample of articles, but also every mention of national and cultural identities and material culture at the grounds of the fair that ultimately referred to the geopolitical entity represented on the grounds. So, for example, occurrences of “Brazilian” were lumped together with occurrences of “Brazil” since, even if the mention was referring to the Brazilian pavilion, or the Brazilian coffee, or the Brazilian committee, it was ultimately referring to Brazil for it was a participating entity at the fair, and therefore it contributed to shaping the imagined geography of modernity.</p>

<p>   Of course, this approach comes with complications. Taking into account every mention of nationality and its variations in the corpus required a lot of close reading parallel to the distant reading methodologies.[^17] For example, the emergence of dubious terminology like “Indian”, which could either refer to the nationality of India or to Native groups represented at the fair, led me to investigate each occurrence on a case-by-case basis before assigning each mention geographical coordinates of a particular place in the world. Other cases where terms like “America” could refer to Latin America rather than the United States were also closely examined before the geocoding process. Further, close reading of a good chunk of the articles sample was important to understand particularities of the historical context of colonization in some cases, like a few occurrences of “German” referring to “German East Africa.” Similarly, in the wake of the Russo-Japanese war that happened simultaneously to the fair, mentions to the region of “Manchuria” were often associated to the Japanese exhibit. Where it seemed fit, I have decided to assign general latitude and longitude coordinates of present-day Inner Mongolia – the true geographical target of imperialistic and expansionist policies of the Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan.</p>

<p>   Interventions to the data and the algorithmic process are a crucial component to humanistic inquiry that uses computational tools. In the words of Shanon Leon, when it comes to humanistic inquiry, most data sets cannot “stand on their own without clear and thorough documentation that accounts for the many decision points along the way.”[^18] Similarly, the methodological choices that led me to manually intervene in the automated process of named entity extraction are one fundamental aspect of what distinguishes this project as a work of digital history rather than a work of computer sciences or information technology. Further, Stéfan Sinclair and Geoffrey Rockwell have argued in favor of the interpretive responsibility of humanists and historians engaging with text analysis and quantitative methodologies. They remind us that computational tools do not produce meaning they are rather meant to “facilitate the augmented hermeneutic cycle,”[^19] and in this sense, the automated process of extracting named entities would have been useless without human intervention based on thorough knowledge of the input data and its historical context.</p>

<p>   After many interventions and data cleaning, the final data set of placenames contained 106 unique observations, each presenting one place name extracted from the corpus, the count, and its geographical scale (city, state, country, or region). As seen in Figure 2 below, the two most frequent place names were United States and Philippines, with 287 and 194 occurrences respectively. This result in itself significantly reinforces the core argument of this project: that the spatial narrative of modernity embedded on the grounds of the fair in St Louis was greatly dependent on the otherization of the East. It was indeed a comparative view of the world, like any other world’s fair: in order to showcase and praise the progress of the civilized West, it had to show its counterpoint.</p>
